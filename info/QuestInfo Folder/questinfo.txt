No GXP is awarded for this mob.

In newbieland, go to the farm westish, there is a secret exit 
on the east side of the farm, follow it until you see a tree. 
'climb tree', search nest and get the Lumberjack's axe. Then 
walk around newbieland to find the "Large Red Oak Tree" and 
'chop tree'. The tree could be in ANY of the areas in newbieland.


As a high mortal the tree loads in a random spot every reboot.

PoL was one load position.

Update from someone who didn't write this:
------------------------------------------------

I've never seen the HM tree load anywhere except PoL.
and that's with 5+ hm characters.


codename kodiac

 	

First get a light source (weary peasants in newbieland 
farm carry ring of light). From newbieland entrance/middle go 2s 3e, enter, n, 
nw, u, board. When you get to the planet go all nw, e, search rubble, all nw, 
search elevator, nw, u. Talk to Commander Ford about Kodiak and helping. After a 
while hell tell you to go see Robertson and give you the passcode. Go back down, 
search floor, d. Talk to robertson about kodiak, etc. Then say 'ford sent me'. 
And when he asks for the passcode Ford gave you(random), say it. Hell give you a 
scanner, wear it. Go up and back to the entrance of the area(where you unboarded 
the spaceship). Now you have to search around here by typing 'scan'(while 
wearing the scanner). Its usually 2sw, scan, search forest, but I think it 
changes. Anyway, when you find the room that gives you a reading of '75%', start 
searching, its usually 'search forest' or 'search trees'. Go through the secret 
direction and kill kodiak(hard).

w, all s, w, s, get ladder. Then go n, w, k teacher, search, get the bone. Go s, 
e, all n, 2e, n about to the dog. Give the bone to the dog and hell dig up a 
brick/lego. Anyway, once you have the 2 red and blue blocks, type 'attach long 
red to round blue' (or whatever the blocks are, look at them)...That will make 
the key. go to the southern end of the area (til the ONLY exit is north). Go up, 
n, unlock door, open door, w, kill mack.


I found the bone just north of the town, the room with the sign and only a n and e exit.

From newbeland entrace/middle, 2s, 3e, enter, n, w, 
whistle, go, mortex, go in every room and 'exa man'...find the one with the wire 
cutters and kill him to get them. Then go in the NE corner of the area and 
'enter'. Now 'search tools' or search around to try and find the multimeter. If 
you cant find it get out and go in the SE corner, enter. Search around for the 
multimeter. If you cant find it in there, get out and go 2w, enter. 'search 
seat' then 'search tools' and you should find the multimeter. If you cant find 
it in here, look around, its in the area...When you have both tools, go in the 
SE corner, then go west, up. Now theres 4 wires, test each one('test  
wire') whichever shows a current, type 'cut  wire'. Solved.

djinni

Bring a light source.

Wayhaven, all e, leave, folow road e/ne until you get to the docks.  In the room 
before either dock (exits e or n) swim or swim in ocean.  Swim untili mob, examine 
bottom, search slime, get bottle.  (Key you get from mob can be used to open a tan 
box on the island in this area to get a tan marble).

Once you have the bottle, return home or to a good area.  You may want to put eq 
in a box as you can't use eq or guild powers once inside the bottle.

Remove cork.

You now suck.  I will only say the things you have to do - you may want to kill 
the mobs to get eq as you will have none.

Go to the room with Stinky/Skippy/whatever his name is - he is the newbie.  Here 
you can pick flowers for a 100 hp heal.  Left of him is a room with an anorexic 
slave.  You can exa garden, pick vegetables, get vegetables.  Each vegetable gives 
approx 100 hp heal.  You will need these!

Go to the mage, wait until he says the magic word 'Kazam'

To the right of the mage, search rocks for a hunting knife, this helps ALOT!

Go to centre and say key in front of a mob (I did this with the rogue but I assume 
it will work for any of them).  Mob will tell you which little mob in the outer 
circle has their particular key.  Go to them and say key again.  They will give 
you a key to the door.

Kill guard in inner circle (I found him pretty hard), unlock door, go 2n - here is 
the mage (non-aggro)

I would suggest having as many flowers/vegetables and ppl available for hmheal from 
afar as possible for this bit.

Kill mage, get sword. Go s, search room, say kazam, climb stairs, give sword to 
Djinni.

south", "frozen realm northeast", or "in the southeastern forest". The locations 
are random, but go to the area he says, and in every room type 'search'. In one 
room it will uncover the location of a shelter, enter shelter, kill orc shaman, 
get orc slayer. Return to Eldurazil, and wait for quest points.

scavenger hunt

From cot, 2s, whisper psst, 2u, get list. I can only give hints at how to 
do this quest. Look in your guild box/equipment room, look at Cancer's, 
and watch the auction line. Each list is randomized and some of the items 
are so bizarre that you might never find them. Make sure you watch 
capitalization. The item MUST match EXACTLY as it is on your list.

hidden treasure

From wayhaven portal, go 12n, leave, 7n, 8e, shore, n, 2ne, swim 
ship, ...wait. Now the object is to find 6 parchments, and a pair of glasses on 
the ship. The locations are random so you have to go in every room and search 
EVERY noun until you find the 6 pieces and glasses. Kill ALL of the mobs(they 
drop hidden parchments sometimes). When you have all 6 pieces, 'arrange pieces', 
from the entrance to the ship(exits: down, aft, fore) 'climb mast', 'scan 
horizon', remember the direction that land is in, go d, aft, u, kill captain, 
check heading, 'turn wheel starboard/port'. Keep turning the wheel until 'check 
heading' reads the direction that you saw the land in, ...wait a bit to land. 
When you land 'exa map' and follow the directions on the map. It's random so you 
have to do a bit of searching. 'Leagues' are equal to one direction (ie. 3 
leagues east = 3e). When you get there, 'dig'. (I had trouble finding it, so i 
just spammed back and forth where it told me. You also cant dig unless the map 
is assembled too).


kimalrk

East forest portal, 3e, se, 4e, n, embark, fore, bridge, tell captain kimlark, ...wait, 
deck, fore, disembark, 3w, 4s, exa cliff, search cliff, up, 2s, u, 3w, n, u, w, 3n, w, 
kill guards, look at the oil painting, search country scene, enter oil, enter cottage, 
request story, ...wait a while until she finishes, out, enter rent, e, 3s, 2e, kill 
thief, ne, n, e, DON'T GO DOWN, kill the guards, search rocks, enter cave, d, the Gnome 
Warlord is east, get someone big to kill him, then get the amulet from his pack. Now go 
back up, out, w, s, sw, 2w, 3n, w, n, move grate. Now you're in a maze, wear the amulet, 
kill dragon, get key, se, search dung, d, (go to the end of the maze, dirs are a bit 
wrong): 3e, s, e, n, e, 2s, 3w, n, 2w, kill gnome, 2s, 3e, s, 2w, kill gnome, s, 2e, 
kill gnome, n, e, s, e, kill gnome, unlock door, n, kill minotaur, kill ghost, get all, 
s, w, n, w, s, 2w, climb cleft. Find your way back to the dragon's room and go up. Go 
back to the castle's throne room (2e from oil painting). Sit on throne, open chest, 
place crystal in chest. 


miyu

In order to get into the area find the walking boy in chaos and trace his 
symbol. What is wierd with this quest is the exits. Instead of E/W/N/S they 
have right/left/forward/backward What this mean is that if you type right you 
turn right from the way you are facing. IE if you face E you will end up South. 
If you face North you will end up East and so on. This is very confusing but 
once you get to know the system you will do fine.

            5

This is what you want to do:

-1 is the starting point 
-Go first to number 2 you can enter house in this square and you will come into 
 a broken and ruined room. 
-Search around and you will find a mirror I think. 
-Something will grab it but kill him and get the mirror. Pay attention to the 
 picture on the wall in this room as well. 
-Now go to 5 and back up one room so you are _NOT_ in the room with Miyu herself. 
-Drop all and walk back to the room with Miyu. 
-Have her kiss you and go and retrieve your items. 
-If you kiss her while carrying items she makes you drop them and she will get them. 
-Ok now head up to 3 and you will find a HUGE armoured monster. He is not 
 aggressive but he will also pick up everything you drop. 
-He will heal to full if you leave the room as well so I suggest bring a buttload 
 of healing. (He is WAY hard too). 
-Before you start wailing on him use the mirror on it and it will fall to its knees 
 and it is now possible to hurt him. 
-Kill him off BUT take the head. Chop head works. 
-Go back to 2 and insert head in picture (I think this is the synytax but it can't 
 be that hard to figure out) 
-Go to 4 and buy a dose of reality to leave the area. 


ravenloft II

In Ravenloft, from the Barovia sign, go west until you get to Donavich, kneel. 
Get all the stuff. Then you have to find the gypsy in the forest west of Barovia. 
(Something like w, s, 4sw, nw is the forest). Then kill the golem when you find 
it, unlock door, open door, west, ...wait, pray. She will port you to another 
area. There is a time limit, so hurry up. Check the hourglass for remaining time. 
Go enter, e, s, w, search organ, w, s, w, search slits, get invitation, e, n, 2e, 
n, 2w, ne, se, e. Watch the wedding and killing until it says that you have to 
get the relics before Strahd does. Go w, nw, sw, enter, 4e, get all, ...wait, 
kill strahd as fast as you can, then go all the way west and pray.


covenant

 	

From chaos, go 4w, e, s, w, s, read book. Now go west, search 
wall, turn doorknob, search cabinet, get penknife. From here go 5e, 10n, w, kill 
nurse, get syringe, search cabinet, get splints. From here go e, n, 3e, s, w, 
search box, get twine. From here go e, n, e, s, push crack, search 
pentagram(you'll get antifreeze). From here go n, w, 3s, 3w, 5s, e, ne, 2e, 2n, 
kill bodyguard, enter tent, open bar(you'll get alcohol). From here go out, 2s, 
e, open box, read sheet(remember directions), 2e, sw, 4w, immobilize leg, stop 
circulation, sterilize penknife, cut swelling, suck poison. Now go out, e, 10s, 
3w,n, w, n, d, 3e, enter pipe, e, d, search scum, enter hole. Now you've got to 
run around this extremely annoying maze, by typing 'enter crack' in different 
rooms, until you come to the Snake King. Kill the king, get the key. Now get a 
teleport out, and form the entrance room, go west, search desk, unlock 
compartment, wear band.

-Splints are in the luxury RV in the trailerpark, 'lift covers' to get them

-In the room Sam the Evangelist is in(in trailerpark). exa sam, exa depression.  sr depression. 
KILL SAM. get the card, enter trapdoor. search. exa indentation. search 
indentation. get key.  then exa pipe.  exa cover, sr cover. 'slot card'
***IF YOU DON'T KILL SAM YOU WILL HAVE TO QUIT OUT OR DIE***
       -This gives you a key that I'm not quite sure is used for
-Alcohol is  3e/5n/4w/north/search stage or something in the room.

You don't need the antifreeze to do the quest.

the secret of nimh

chaos, 3e, 5s, press play.  Go south, search fence, exa haze, enter haze.  Wander 
around the field until you find a cement block and enter it.  Talk to Mrs. Brisby 
and ask her about Timmy.  She'll give you a piece of paper to take to Mr. Ages.  
Go s, all w, n, w, all n.  Climb the harvester and squeeze through the cracks and 
find Mr. Ages.  Talk to him about Timmy and tell him how badly ill he is.  Give 
him the list of paper and he'll tell you to find a piece of wire or tubing.  The 
tubing is the in se room of the Brisby house where all the kids are (exa window/
curtains, search window/curtains).  The wire is in the flower bed by the house 
(search flowers).  Give the wire or tubing to Ages and he'll give you a packet of 
medicine to give to Ms. Brisby.  Give Mrs. Brisby the medicine and she'll direct 
you to Auntie Shrew. Find here wandering the fields.  She'll tell you to find the 
Great Owl.  Go to the Mill south of the fields and talk to Jeremy...he'll tell you 
that he'll take you if you bring him some sparklies (there are a total of 4):  
Penny - search weeds s/e or s/2e of where you start or in the potplants on the 
porch of the farmhouse, Quartz - go all s in the field, all w, e search lane, 
Glass - se corner of the field, search ground, Foil - first room of the mill, 
search holes/search river/search water.  Give them to Jeremy until he accepts one.  
Ride him to the Owl.  Owl tells you to find the rats and to tell Nicodemus to move 
to the "lee of the stone".  Return to the fields and find the rosebush by the 
house.  Push thorn to get to the rats.  Talk to Brutus about brisby and Nicodemus 
and he'll tell you to talk to Ages.  Talk to Ages to get proof and return to 
Brutus, he'll tell you to push top corner to get in.  Go down, search soldiers to 
reveal Justin.  Go south to the elevator and search around, return to Justin and 
ask about the lantern and he'll tell you to stamp floor to go down.  Talk to Jenner 
and Sullivan about brisby and jonathon and they will take you to Nicodemus.  Talk 
to Nico and tell him lee of the stone and accept his offer to take out Dragon the 
cat.  As soon as you get to the hole, run n and 2e (i think) to the food bowl and 
"drug food" and return to the hole.  You'll get caught and put in a birdcage.  exa/
search papers, sweater, thread, pull thread.  Kick water tray to get out. Tie 
thread to get down.  Then kill Sullivan and then Jenner (jenner is no-leave, about 
58k).  Take the amulet and give it to Brisby.


boomer crisis

Start by mapping out Mega-Tokyo yaddayadda. Near the northeast corner is
the police station, Ayako Ikeda is the Police chief. His office is all south, 
then through the unobvious door to the south. Talk to him, he tells you that
you need to find some kinda proof about Genoms involvement with the 
Yoshiko Military Supply Company. He tells about the secret hideout of some
thugs in the  samuri ally and says you need a key, which can be found in the
Judge's office which is also in the police station. It's all west then through an
unobvious exit to the west. Key is on the floor behind the desk. The alley is 
along the eastern edge, and just a west exit in one of the rooms. Keep going
west looking for the door, in a few spots some ninjas will jump you and beat
you up. Inside the are is some stuff, I honestly can't remember since it was
really easy and I have a terrible memory. But anyways, in one of the rooms 
there's a desk with some folders on it, in one of them is a file on the Genom
project. This room is up the stairs from the first room and all east.  You must
bag or drop all equipment to get by the sensor that keeps beeping.  'Get invitation' is the syntax. Go back to Ayako. He
tells you that he needs more proof he mentions that there is an informant 
that wants to give information in the Yoshiko company, find him and speak 
the secret code word 'Mishcief'. He's in the Yoshiko building along the easter 
edge on the main floor in an obvious room. He gives you an open invitation 
to meet Mr. Quincy. Give this to Ayako. After a few words he is assasinated 
by an unknown assailant. With the invitation you can go into the Genom corp
 building to talk to Mr. Quincy. Genom Corp in in the NW corner. enter 
building then talk to the lamer. mention invitation and he'll talk about a 
secret elevator on the west wall, 'enter elevator' and you'll go up to see him. 
He'll talk about some junk and about how he's not involved if/when you 
mention Ayako Ikeda he'll push some button and send you to a secret room 
where some thugs come attack you. After you kill them do some searching, 
on a corpse there will be an identification card that you can use to travel the 
whole of Genom building. To get out just 'climb garbage'. Back into the 
genom building. It's just a bunch of floors with some rooms and lame mobs, 
sometimes some security guards. The way to travel to the next floor is 
through a teleportation room or something. Just keep going up and 
eventually you get to the top and back to Mr. Quincy. I just killed him at this 
point, I really don't know if you have to, but whatever, you need him alive 
later to get out. In his office there's a secret button near his desk, it opens 
up the door to the survailance room. in the room there's a cardridge you can 
get form one of the machine. Take it and give it to the judge and the quest 
is over.


cernunnos

Go to the Wayhaven library and look up Cernunnos and runes.  Go north
and east of Wayhaven and find the  druidic stones there (you'll be able 
to go up), in the center of the stones there's a stone, get the stone look
at it and  rub it. Kill this incarnation of Cernunnos - Cernunnos is the Celtic
leader of the hunt.  Okay, now go to the Cernunnos area (east forest
portal/e/4s/w/2s/w/s there's a priest somewhere down there.  Get into the
forest and climb to the top of the hill-2w,sw,se,2 sw, 2s, 3 se, 2en, sw, w,
2 nw, n, ne, 2se, n (you'll notice the path you follow runs in a circle, keep
trying to go directions into the circle to goup the hill). To get out of the forest
you'll have to find a path at the bottom of the hill that leads south back to
the entrance, it'll be hidden as well. Go to the top of the hill, look at the
runes on the stones you pass and try and make head or tales of them.  At
the top of the hill you'll have to rub your stone again and itll say something
about warming the stones. get a torch and light the fires at the bases of the
stones. the rub the pebble again. it says you need something conductive,
which is an amulet.  from here go w, nw, ne, e, se, sw, and search around for
it. then go back to the top, rub pebble and kill cernunnos. this time though
you get a sword and helmet when you kill him. Then to finish the quest kill all
the menhir's but examine the rune on each one, finally you'll kill one with a @
rune and you'll get the qps.  Don't leave the area until you kill the right one.
They respawn fairly quick so just map the place and follow your map until you've
killed each menhir.

ring of power


Go to the zoo in chaos. From Da Void, it's n, w, n, and then search around a bit.
it's near the hide and seek quest. Enter the zoo, go 3n into zookeeper's house. 
Move the rug and get the key to open the drawer in his desk. Get the journal
and read it all.  Go s, 4w, s, sw, w, kill polar bear, get feather.  Go e, ne, 4n, 
enter tree, kill lion, get horn.  Leave the tree, go 2s, nw, w, kill panther, get
tail.  Go e, se, s, enter house, kill zookeepers. Clean mirror, gaze mirror. You 
are transported to place with a maze. Now, make sure you have plenty of
healing... lots of maze guardians that don't hit hard, but there can be lots of 
them. Also make sure you have something to mark your way through the maze 
or you will be terminally lost! Enter the maze. You will soon find that directions 
don't correspond: so that if you go left to get to one room, if you then go right 
you probably won't end up back where you began. So mark the rooms and work 
out the directions.  There are 15 rooms total.  You are in the right place when 
you are in front a castle, but DON'T ENTER YET.  Search stone, go down,
kill dragon.  Put horn in conical hole, put feather in oblong hole, put tail in 
cylindrical hole, get ring of power.  Then go up. If you need healing go back, 
else enter castle, go up, kill wizard (he's fairly nasty, but not TOO bad), enter 
crack, melt ring in lava.


the project


Enter Science, go all the way north through Houston and out into the
wastelands then go: n, and about 5 or 6 w, then north into Nanook's desert
area.  Go a couple north and west until you see a compound (it's a small 
area, so it won't take you long to find it).  Enter the compound and then go all
 the way north to the shuttle to Mars.  There is a messenger here that you can
 speak to. Ask him about Mars and mines and stuff. Go to the shuttle, enter it
 and go to Mars.  On Mars you're inside a large covered colony. Map it. The 
shuttle is in the most north eastern part of the colony. The areas aren't really 
very big, so it won't take you long to map it. From the shuttle, go:2 sw, w, sw, 
w, d, 2w, sw, nw, n, nw, n, ne, n, enter massage parlor. You can speak to the 
woman at the back by the stairs.  Go up the stairs and
into a room with a woman in it. If she has a passcard then kill her and get it. 
If she doesn't then you'll need to look around on wandering workers for one.  
Leave the massage parlor, go back s, sw, s, se, s, se, then go: sw, 2s, and 
into the large plaza area.  Wander around here until you find a tourist
with a camcorder. Kill them and get it. You'll need the camcorder to record 
what you see down in the mines.  In the north east part of this plaza is the
news office, where you'll need to take the info you get to solve the quest.  
Find the secret genetics lab. From where you entered on the shuttle, go: 2sw, 
w, nw, n, w, and use the elevator to go down. Wander about in the mines until
 you find a door with a card reader. You'll need to use the passcard that you 
got to open the door and enter the lab.  If you can't find the door in these 
mines, then try the mines on the surface of the planet. First buy an 
environment suit from the shop in the south east area of the plaza. If
you leave the colony without it then you'll die. Wear the suit!  Then go to the 
airlock in the sw area of the plaza, and go out on to the surface of the planet.
 From here, go: 5w, 2n, e (hidden exit) and into the mines here. Once you 
enter the lab, immediately attack the scientist here(Dr. Gnolwright). Kill him. 
He'll summon orderlies to attack you, so if you have some sort of calming 
power then use it.  Once he's dead, then go east into his office. Search 
through the computer stuff. Search disks until you find one that
looks important. Get disk.  Then go back west, n to a pit. Look at the pit full 
of bodies.  Start recording on the camcorder (the description tells you how). 
Stop recording again. Then go back to the news woman in the plaza in the 
colony.  She'll immediately takethe objects that you have.  Finished.


***Keycard can also be upstairs from the tavern, search around***


rutha-al

First things first. Head to Ruath-Al tomb on taslen. Its on the south side of 
the island, obvious entrance. Theres a mini pyramid stone that you can 
manipulate. Can't remember exactly how.

Once in, turn the torch mentioned in the room description to make a ladder
appear. Fly down it. Theres a specific message for levitation, and it
the stuff mentions the ladder is not safe. I assume you would take damage.

You'll now be in a bath house. Look search etc.  Eventually you'll see the
grate. Lift it. continue flying down. You'll be in a pit with no obvious exit. 
Search stones to find the stone with the imperfection / keyhole. Search slime
for the key. It will spawn a slime mob to fight first. 'turn key' To unlock the door. 


Now you're in a room with obvious exits and unreadable heiroglyphs. Talk
to the npc below for a bit of info. She'll talk about a missing Dervish 
eventually, I forget what word to use. If you say something based on that 
say, even more innane, she'll mention the book you already know about - 
since you've looked at her. Pull arm, stairs,e,get body,w,stairs (if stares 
are gone, turn/twist statue),stairs,give body to iaseda. You get the book.

There's 3 heiroglyphs I've read. They're all in plain sight.
There's a fourth heiroglyph I've never read. You have to leave the area 
and get back in to read it. I've never bothered.

the heiroglyph: In the lair of the Naga
the heiroglyph: Dig to find him
the heiroglyph:  Kneel down and pay homage to Aviatu

Other possible heiroglyphs(there player based I'm assuming):
the heiroglyph: In the lair of the Dog
the heiroglyph: Spin to find him


So go back down the stairs, southwest of this room there is a warddrobe room.  Search around in here and keep searching the coats and clothes.  
You'll get a message about a bulge in a pocket.  
search the pocket/bulge and then take key from pocket.and do the kneel 
again. The syntax is exactly as the heiroglyph says.

Now you can enter the hole. Levitate or have rope, fly, etc. Whatever you 
need. As a mage I just levitate.

Then pull sceptre. It will open a stairway. Down the hatch you go. Before 
you do, note the sarcophagus of Ruath-Al in this room. The lid can be 
removed, but no more interaction other than that, that I discovered. So it 
may not be the real deal.

Now you're in a looping section that may or may not be the base of the 
temple. 

Pretty simple map, although theres lots of emotes to make you think 
things are looping. Theres only 8 rooms with bodgy exits.
      _
     / \
  *-N   N-*
  |X|   |X|
  W-*   *-E

  *-S   S-*
     \_/
Where I've put letters, using N rooms as an example, the western N is a 
ne exit that connects to the eastern N, and the eastern N has a nw exit 
that connects to the western N. Same rule applies for the other dirs. Thats 
the only thing that'll bugger up your map.

In the northeastern corner you can dig. The Naga's lair is one NE of C. C is 
the rope/centre.

If your heiroglyph is the lair of the dog/spin. You spin in the NW corner.

Dig in that corner, and a portal appears. Enter it to fight a 250k noleave 
hard as hell Beholder. It'll block attacks like Cathcargan. Took me ages. 
Theres a door in there, just go 'door' and the key works itself out.  Open coffin to summon Rutha-Al. 

***DO NOT USE LIGHTNING DAMAGE OR YOU WILL BLICK YOURSELF***

Kill Rutha-Al, he's about 350k and hard as fuck, much harder than beholder so make sure your .
When he's dead, your all done. Leave the room, pull lever to reopen the portal and leave.


The lore on the sceptre:
You carefully study Sceptre of Might (evil)...
A warrior would be proud to use this.
This does absurd crushing damage.
This weapon has special attacks or powers.
Uh, is this thing made of diamond?

This item has a detailed history:
This large sceptre is an ancient relic once owned by the evil Taslenian
pharaoh Rutha-Al.  Rutha-Al wielded the sceptre throughout his reign
bringing fear and oppression upon the people of Taslen.

Rumored to be the essence of the god himself, this mighty sceptre would
be the bane of all foes of someone who was corrupt enough to possess
this
weapon.

In battle the pharaoh was able to call upon the speed of his god and
strike down his foes with two or even three times the might of a normal
human.  When being covert was necessary, the pharaoh would call upon his
god for stealth and silence and be able to move and sneak in on his
foes.
And when truly necessary, the pharaoh was able to harness the power of
his
god and smitten his foe with almost certain death.

It is rumored that harnessing the power of the god causes even more
corruption in ones soul, and there could be dangerous effects for
calling
up on the gods.  Nobody knows what caused the downfall of Rutha-Al in
ancient times, but there is plenty of tales of this very sceptre
striking
back during a battle extinguishing his existence.


    call upon Apotep for speed
    call upon Apotep for stealth   
    call upon Apotep for smite   

Must be evil to wield.


megatech


 	

You have to go from the subway, u,4w,3s,all w, kill enforcers,
n, 2w, n, kill enforcers open door, west, free man, and talk to him. 
He'll give you a card and tell you about bob, now you go back
to the subway, go u,5n,3e,5n,w,n,2w,4n then enter, and look
at the stove, walls, and stuff.  It will tell you to turn one of 
them (it changes) or turn knob, or turn handle, but if you
turn the wrong one a hole will come.  If you enter the hole,
you'll die. You should find a down exit, go down and show the card
you got from the man you freed and he will give you a
bunch of passkeys.   Now, from level 300-450 you have to use
the passkeys.  In each room you have to 'search', and in some
you find a panel.  One should say just that it's black, but the
one you want to find is the one that is long, and it has
'[ready]' on it. Now when you find the [ready], insert the lowest
number of the passkeys you have (should get a 3,5,7,10)
and so on.  On level 300, use passkey 3, and on level 350 use 
passkey 5 and such, this is the hard part.  Anyway, once inside, the directions are approximately: 
Level 50->100, all east, all s, should be like 3 or 5n, then go west.
Level 100->150 all east, all south, (sw corner) 2e,all north, e, n.
Level 150->200 w,n,6e,s,w.
Level 200->250 2e,s,10w,10n,e,2s
Level 250->300 4n,e,s 
All the Levels after 300 you have to find the panel, which is different for 
each person. 'search' in each room for them and you'll find panels
in some.  Look at panel and when you see a [ready] insert the
correct passkey (lowest one that you have) check the numbers
by looking at front of passkey.  On floor 500 go all west to
Ancient Western dragon and kill it. Go west again and kill Arnold Hesler.

prismatic jewel

First things first. Do your research.

Goto the Wayhaven Library, and lookup all that you can. Prismatic Jewel, 
Prismatic Dragons, Dragon Isle, etc etc. Theres plenty of lookups, I cannot 
remember them all.

Now head to tapan.

If you are familiar with the Mira quest, this should be simple. 

On the east side of tapan is a cliff you can climb down, climb down it, and 
enter the cave. In here is a dragon protecting gold. If I recall theres a Mira 
quest item in here, but that is not the purpose of our visit. Get the gold.

Getting the gold will not get the gold, but will simply anger the Red Dragon.

Have a bit of a peck at it, but don't kill it. This is important. After a while, 
the fight will stop, the dragon will pick you up in its claws, and dump you 
on the Prismatic Jewel Island.

Items you will need for the solution.

A red bag. A stalagmite. A 'coloured' gem.

The quest is actually very simple.

The bag can load in several places. It can be on some flowers near some 
monkeys in the tree. Or it can be in one of the various dragon nests. It 
may also be in the human's cave. I've only ever found it in the tree with 
one character, and the nest in another.

The stalagmite can probably load in any cave that has stalagmites.
'break stalagmite' for me it was in the start cave.

First things first.

Drop everything. And I mean ecerything. If it did not autoload on, you 
shouldn't be carrying it. If you have a weightless way of transporting 
equipment, such as a follower or wieghtless guild bag, use it. If you are 
carrying anything, anything at all, even items that reduce wieght, this 
section of the quest will fail.

Leave the opening cave and turn northwards. You may have to despatch a 
dragon. Most of the dragons are 80k and reasonably harmless. The pearl 
one can stun real bad. Climb the cliff. It might be good form to actually try 
and work this out and fail abit. Falling off the cliff will cost you hp. If you've 
given up or just want to plain well cheat, the path is following:

Bam. You're on the cliff. Follow the path around, entering all the caves, 
searching all the bones, killing all the dragons. Take one of each gem. 
You only need one gem total, but you wont know which one that is for 
quite some time.

Follow the path all the way to the end, and go visit the proper questy 
dragon if you like. He'll attack you if you don't have prismatic jewel.

We're done here for now.

Go back to the start of this volcano top, and jump down. Head south, and 
down into the jungle.

Sw,s from the jungle start is a hidden cave. Search and find it. If theres a 
nest, enter it, and search about. If the dragons prevent you from 
searching mud, then the red pouch is here. Check for a stalagmite if you 
dont have one. Move on.

se,se,e,e is another cave location. Repeat.

e,e,ne is a liana. 'climb liana'. Its a type of vine, if that ever becomes 
relevant. Check the flowers / monkeys for the red pouch. Down we go.

e,ne,ne Another Liana. This one actually allows us to cross the river we 
have been following. Don't cross over just yet.


e,e brings us to a liana drop. We can climb down there, and get into an 
inlet with a waterfall. Behind the waterfall is a humans dwelling. This may 
be a location for the red pouch. I honestly do not know. Go lagoon, beach.

Check the cave out. Get the rest of the rooms, theres only a few, and 
nothing to search. When you're done, return to the waterfall and 'push 
off'.

This will return you to Wayhaven. Back to Tapan. Back to flying on 
dragonclaw. Back to the liana we climbe down.

2w, climb liana, across, d, 2 nw, here is another cave. Red bag, 
stalagmites. Etc.

== BE CAREFUL ==

In the next rooms, nw is a group of 4 killer bees.

They will all attack you. They all do addhp2 damage. Yes, not addhp, 
addhp2. It can be as heavy as 120hp per round. The room is wimpyable. 
But very dangerous. Kill everything, move on. 

West of here is another tree, climb, bag etc. Follow the one way path 
westward. All w. 2 sw, hidden cave, bag etc.

 Keep going.

2 more sw and you will come across a bush. Search the bush for a ring. 
Remember the old qinfo saying Peridot ring of adornment is really a 
marble, and trying to get one, and get your marble? Well this is the 
peridot ring of adornment. It isnt any ring of adornment, its this specific 
one. Get your marble. Continue along the path. You will encounter a leaf 
man, he is similar to the killer bees.Theres another three caves. Two 
insignifcant ones, and one impotant one. There is also one liana to climb.

Into the significant cave. The bat cave.

Head north and you will come to a dead ender. Search corner. Cave opens 
up. Map it. Theres 56 rooms. All obvious. GO up when you get there. There 
are plenty of mobs here, the death bats are great, and the invisible 
wraiths can be killed by searching shadows. Every single room contians 
stock text. Search for credibility, but dont expect to find anything. Onto the 
next floor. Stairs on the southeast side btw.

Same deal. Search, make bs gxp, whatever, Stairs are on the north side.

Third floor. This one matters.
2e, se, s, search rubble. Find hidden exit. I didn't see any point to it. 
Perhaps it will matter to your instance.

sw,3w, search about. Hidden tunnel.
Follow it. When you're trapped by a web, clear it.

== Exact Dirs Stop Here ==

I appear to have misplayed my prismatic jewel maps.
Anyway. Follow the stairs down, and eventually you will meet a mob.

say master.
say price.

He will want a -colour- gem.

The syntax is 'pay colour' I think. Its not give. And its never gem. You 
manipulate the colour. I solved this quite a while ago. Qinfo/Maps half 
missing. Anyway. Give over the gem and you're allowed in.

Now you're in a room with a vampire. Don't try to kill it, you'll die. He's 
immune to every damagetype. 'throw stalagmite' to kill the vampire. 
Open the coffin for the prismatic jewel. Put it in the pouch, and make you 
way back to the top of the volcano.

Get the gem out of the pouch, and give it to the dragon in the middle of 
the Caldera. You're done.


seahaven


 	

Note: If you're going to cheat, please don't solve until February.

Head down to cirrus's seahaves, sw of wayhaven, and kill the 
anemone. 'gather' in all 4 rooms until you find a swimmers corpse carrying 
swimming trunks. Wear them, and swim swim, from the anemone's room. 
Talk to the mermaid there as mentioned in the questlist. she wants a 
book, gives history of seahaven, craps on about stuff. if you search her 
mirror you find a spherical piece of coral. It's a marble if I recall. swim 
back, 2se, push boulder (many times) you get into a cave. d. Now a bunch 
of tentacles attack you. A 130k class mob is 2n from here, and the 
tentacles drag you that way, so keep spamming south while getting rid of 
the tentacles, unless you want to get owned.
 
After dispatching the tentacles, head 2 in and fight the Head of Bartek. 
130k, reasonable sized mob. search the room once its gone and you find 
a snowshovel. This snowshovel belonged to an adventurer in the mermaids 
story.
 
Head up to seahaven, that would be in the glacier area, north eastern 
room. ice portal, 2s,6e,n,e,n,climb glacier,jump snow,dig snow,tunnel.
 
From here, you're goal is to get to room '2' on the below map.

Step one: Work all this crap out for yourself. Its not that hard. Surely you'll 
just get pinged for qinfo if you don't stuff this up a billion times.

Step two: After you've given up, follow these instructions. 

Step three: Dig out all the @'s until you're at the layer of *'s. Note the 
loose boulder near the path down. If you go near it, the quest is ruined for 
12 hours. Dig out every room except  for 4 and 3. Now dig out 4. And 
move to the west of it. Bounce w/e to refresh the room. The end result is a 
pyramid of boulders. base 5, 3 in the middle, and 1 to the east of you. 
Push boulder east. Move east. Push boulder west. Move west. Push boulder 
east. Move east. Etc. The result you're aiming for is two lines of 6 boulders.

##        4         ##
## #    oooooo####3 ##
## #  #oooooo###     #
######################


Step four: We now have a clear path to drop boulders in the east pit. If 
you're on the east side, dump a boulder west.Now move a boulder east. 
Just push it as far as you can. It'll drop when it can't go further. Dig out 3. 
Go down twice, and push it into the east crevasse. Dump another boulder 
west. Next east boulder, it'll drop past 3, go east of it, push it west twice. 
Dump a west boulder. Fiddle with another east one appropriately.

Step five: All the tricky parts are now done. Your map should now look like 
this:

##        4         ##
## #   ooooooo####  ##
## #oo#oooooo###oo  o#
######################

This section of the quest can now be completed simply by, if you're on the 
east side, pushing west boulder as far as it goes, and returning east, and 
vice versa. After all the boulders are out of the way, collect your explorer 
rooms. Its all stock glacier text, and onto the next puzzle.

The Ice Dragon
-----------------

You're now in a section of the ice caves full of stock text. The second room 
in, is the dragons trap. So get your snow shovel out, and dig pit. 'scramble 
out' when its done. Now collect 4 logs. In the most northwest area of the 
map is the ice dragon, and there are no logs near it. So just map the place 
and get the 4 logs. Go to the pit room. 'place log over pit' four times. 
Now 'cover logs with snow' or similar syntax. The pit is now hidden. Go to 
the extreme northwest section of the map and collect the ice dragon. It 
cannot be killed by melee, you need to trap it. Drag it one north of the pit, 
and 'leap pit'. Tada. Dragon gets trapped. I don't know what happens if 
you leave north after this. I leap pit'd a second time. Walk to the dragons 
lair and continue north into the city of Seahaven, open gates.

The Ten Queens Problem
----------------------------

You're now in a 10x10 chessboard as such, every room has a double cross 
that you can place an item onto. On the northeast corner is a cave with a 
stand, with 10 crosses.

The goal of this puzzle is to place these 10 double crosses, or queens, on 
the board so that none of them can attack each other. The easiest 
solution is the super-queen solution, and you can work this one out without 
even being a math god. Theres four super queen solutions (4 rotations) 
and it works like this.

I got my solution here: http://www.durangobill.com/N_Queens.html

Here's four.

oooooooXoo     ooXooooooo     oooXoooooo     ooooooXooo
ooooXooooo     oooooXoooo     oooooooXoo     ooXooooooo
oXoooooooo     ooooooooXo     Xooooooooo     oooooooooX
oooooooooX     Xooooooooo     ooooXooooo     oooooXoooo
ooooooXooo     oooXoooooo     ooooooooXo     oXoooooooo
oooXoooooo     ooooooXooo     oXoooooooo     ooooooooXo
Xooooooooo     oooooooooX     oooooXoooo     ooooXooooo
oooooooXoo     ooXooooooo     oooooooooX     Xooooooooo
ooooXooooo     oooooXoooo     ooXooooooo     oooooooXoo
oXoooooooo     ooooooooXo     ooooooXooo     oooXoooooo


Note the pattern.

That one can be rotated 3 more times, to create 4 'simple' solutions. 
Theres 92 other solutions, with symetry and rotation for a total of 724 
solutions. It would be best if we did not all use the same chess solve.

After all the crosses are in place, go into the cave, and align crystal after 
look/search etc. A new exit will open up north, and the quest is pretty 
much done. Theres an oyster to open up that does nothing for you, but 
shows briefly a mummified mermaid baby. On the table is a diary. Pick it 
up, and climb down into the boat. Obvious exit if I recall. Spin wheel a 
bunch of times and wait. Your ship will fly off and dump you near cirrus's 
seacave, swim back to the mermaid and give the diary over. Flap flap flap 
quest points.


kill bahamut


For this quest you will need five teeth, and the demon catalyst.

First things first, visit Shamus in the open field for information. He's in the 
northern sunflower path. He has information, but won't respond to says. 
But if you're a thorough questor, even a cheating one, you'll say things 
anyway. Your next stop, is underdark to fetch the Dragons Teeth.

You'll need to be the one who personally deals the killing blow, if that is an 
issue. They're only 20k mobs.

There are five teeth. Black dragon is found on the first level of the 
underdark maze to the north, White dragon is found on the first level of 
underdark maze to the southwest, and the Blue dragon is found on the 
first level of the underdark maze right in the dead center.

If you deal the killing blow they will say things.

With its dying breath, the Dragon utters: 'The first key is b'...

etc. For me, the keys were BLRWG in lower case, twice in a row. This is 
probably selected on a player by player basis.

The green dragon is found in the Dragon Realms, through the vortex on 
the eastern side of the first level of underdark. Its the only room with 
more than level 1 darkness. And if you're reading this you should be 
familiar anyway. Force your way up many times, or just kill the Guardian 
first. 

Red Dragon has multiple spawn points. The first is with Gor Shirek on level 
two, who is probably only killed these days at the hands of old qinfo. The 
second is with the brave elven warrior on level two which is around the back 
of the Armed Demon. And the third load point is Deep Mountain. 
Plain 'search' multiple times in the portal room, climb wall, north.  A fourth 
spawn point is in the second level of the maze in the northeast corner, 
search in the room and theres a hidden exit east.

For the catalyst.

To get the Catalyst you need to do a few things, first there you need to 
listen to what the ravaging drow has to say. He can be found from shed 
3d/3n/nw/3w/u. Just wait there and he'll say a bunch of stuff including 
some directions.

The relevant says are:

Drow says: Archways of life...      
Drow says: What is your favorite color...                                  
Drow says: Orange.. No Blue!  AAAAHHHHHHHHH!                             

the colours change per player

Then travel to the 4th level of underdark (Death Demon/Big Ugly/etc.) on 
the western side one of the rooms has a Demon Guard. Kill him, and 
search dust. There is a pressure plate you can press, once you do that 
you'll hear something move from above. Go up to the first level of the 
maze and look in the long descriptions of the rooms until you find one with 
a lever. Pull the lever and you'll be transported to a room with 4 coloured 
archways. Step in the right one. This is where the Raving Drow comes into 
play, what basically tells you which way won't kill you, and if you do it wrong 
it's a death trap and the shout message is "Bad Qinfo" or someshit. Here 
you'll fight some dude and he'll drop the catalyst. To activate it you'll need 
all the letters from the dragons and just play with it 'till you 'activate' it.

You'll automatically pick up the catalyst and be transported to the first 
room of underdark. Return to shamus, give him the give teeth, activate 
the catalyst 'activate catalyst [code]', and hand it all over. I do not know 
what happens if you attempt to attempt the catalyst with a wrong code.

He'll create the dragon slayer. Attack him, and Bahamut shows up.

Before you attack shamus, modify your corpse trigger, to ignore all 
processing if you have any. And do the following:

unwield [Your current weapon]
get slayer from corpse
keep slayer
wield slayer

The weapon identifies to slayer only, not dragon slayer.

If you try to put the slayer in a container or drop it, it will dest. And 
Bahamut will blick you.

When shamus dies, Bahamut will agro you, but you should already be 
wielding the slayer. He dies in two rounds and is class 0. You'll get a 
mudwide echo on this quest, so dear reader, don't be solving it until late 
January 2006.

perplexus


Alrighty then, another fantabulous update from me.

Perplexus. What a goddamn pain in the arse this quest is. Mischief should 
be shot.

So far as I am aware, there is no quest diversity multispawns, it's just 
poorly constructed.

First thing's first, go to Angelo in wforest, head to the statue of perplexus 
and say perplexus 3 times.

You'll be handed a note saying to check out Wzelivens Castle.

Check it out and talk to Wzeliven, don't kill him.

Hi, Job, Perplexus, Angelo, etc.
Bandits, Join, Yes.

You'll be given an amulet to show to Adam. Go into the shacks section of 
Angelo, and there will be a hidden Nw exit. You dont need to search to 
pass through it, but to find it one must search of course.

"show pendant" And Adam will stop jerking you around, and open up some 
underground passages full of Cockroaches, Bandits and Ogres.

On one of the eastern rooms you'll see a hole in the ceiling. With a rope 
and grappling hook that can be bought in angelo, or levitation, you 
can 'climb hole'.

Kill all the thugs in the room and search about. You'll find a ceramic mold. 
2s, kill kill kill, search about. "break statue". You'll get a key that does 
nothing.

Back to the main road, all the way west, search barricade, search junk, 
search bars. Or something like that.

You'll get an iron bar.
Head back through the caves (jump hole) and visit the Blacksmith in 
Angelo. Give him the mold and bar, he'll make you a key.

Head back to Wzeliven, and kill him. Unlock door, Open door, talk to the 
angel.

Key word here other than hi/job/quest/perplexus etc is 'kargile'.

Two things will be learnt from this visit. A, you need to find a wise elf. B, 
you'll get the Holy Avenger.

Back into angelo, head into the inn, search stairs, take scroll and read it.

You'll learn that saying penetrate will get you past the Xaba barrier.

If you have a rope/levitate you can fly up to the railing and theres the 
Perplexus message board and an uninvolved NPC.

Head back out past angelo, to the room with the sign in it. Enter gap, Nw, 
N, Nw, Climb up, Climb up.

Now you're in a section of mountains and forest, 350 rooms deep.

Six points of interest.

Mamakin's Cave: Following the cliff line to the east, you notice something 
shiny on the cliff. Climb down, down.
Royal Tree House: North west side, one room inland from the border, you 
notice a rope ladder. Climb rope.
Temple of Xaba: one room west of the tree house. You'll have to search 
trees.
Elven Castle: Central East Side, visible in the room.
Yeltors Hut: Due west of the castle, several rooms. Visible in room 
description.
Liches Caves: A bit north east of the Tree Complex, odd bush in the room 
description.

Xaba is unrelaed to the quest, but given theres a scroll in Angelo and 
stuff, theres NPCs etc, its worth checking out. Theres a bit of background 
info on the area in there. etc.

Visit Yeltor's hut, first and foremost. Noone home, theres a painting of him 
and her royal highness, Maleena, queen of the elves. Theres also things in 
the room to identify this wise elf as Yeltor. So now we go find Maleena. 
She's in the tree complex. Talk to her a bit and she'll say Yeltor's hiding, 
but say Maleena and he will come.

Now this sucks. He'll only come once per repop. And you have to speak to 
him twice. So there will be a 45+ minute lag in the middle. The room can be reset with scrolls/gentech.

Speak to him about everything. Search the bookshelves for a disintegrated 
book and 'take book', to get it. Mischief does a lot of annoying 'take' 
syntax in all sorts of quests. If you quest honest, you should already know 
to always Take mischief items, not get them.

He'll say he needs his wizard ball from the castle. So go in to the castle.

This bit took me forever, at least 5 attempts over the months. Solving this 
part quickly might even be suspicious. It is a nasty hack.

Kill the three guards at the entrance, head all east, kill the royal guard for 
the jail key, w2,s unlock the cell and go in.

Like Yeltor, he will disappear when you leave, so make sure you say all 
you need to say.

Hi, Job, Collection (or collector), tree, house, royal, family. There will be 
two lengthy says about the tree house, if you havent seen both of them, 
and you leave, the quest is ruined for 45 minutes. After those two lengthy 
says, say key, just to be sure.

Both says trigger different quest things.

So now you know he stashed the key he stole from the treehouse under a 
loose stone in the northmost corridor room.

Go there, search stones, loose stone, etc.

You've been set up. 6x30k mobs magical/fire jump you. Despatch and go 
to the tree house.

He found the key in trinkets, so go to the room one east of Maleena, 
look/search trinkets and you should see a key tried to a string hanging off 
one of the trinkets. It is flat out not there if you have not talked to the 
thief completely. This took me months. With all the attention this site is 
receiving lately, perhaps it would be a good idea to screw this up a bunch 
of times.

You've got the key. Back into the castle, back to the royal guard room, 
and look/search painting, unlock door, n.

Kill the wizard there, 42k, get the ball from his corpse and go back to 
Yeltor.

Wait for him to repop or whatever, keep saying maleena until he comes 
out. And give him the ball.

He will tell you how to get into sanctuary. For me it was say iffu-pleaseus.

In you go, map every room, search etc, be thorough. In one of the e/w 
rooms is a worthless map you can read.

In one of the south rooms is an inscription of a man putting a red object in 
a red thing.

In the north is a rock you cant move, and a springy platform.
In the east is a set of three altars guarded by priests. Kill the priests, 
search the altars, and take the red gem.

If your description of the inscription says green gem or blue gem, I 
suppose you do that instead. For me it was red.

Clang. You can do stuff now.

Go to the rock room, pick it up, walk into the spring room, and drop it.

It's an elevator. Head west, kill the priests, search the altar and play with 
it. Flip switch 4 or 5 times, and a portal opens up. This is the exit. Don't go 
in it, or you wont be able to get back for 45 mins. (gem/rock need to 
repop). Play with the fountain, the skull is on a swivelling t device. Swivel 
skull. Opens a south exit for you to kill Malisto.

Now for this mob, you need to be able to wield, or have a party member 
who can wield, the Holy Avenger the angel gave you.

If you can do that, I suppose this mob is easy. I was not so lucky. He's 
basically immune to regular damage. But not quite. With gates, I was able 
to do 3-8 damage per hit, and he has no regen. The fight took me a bit 
more than two hours to complete. It doesnt matter who deals the killing 
blow. All you want is the cloak he carries.

** I believe the tank is the one who gets marked with the quest update **

Kill it, out the portal, out the castle.

You now have the first major quest item, and the longest to acquire, Cloak 

of Perplexus.

The next piece is the amulet, held by a mob named Krag. He's just 
wandering around the forest, generally next to the lich cave. He wanders 
fast, so when you see him, follow him. Kill, get, move on.

You now have the second quest item, the amulet of perplexus.

Head into the lich cave, map it, go to the northern section, down a south 
fork, kill berserker, south again, kill lich. He'll charm the room a few times, 
so just keep at him. You now have the hilt.

The quillions for the blade are in Wzelivesn castle. Find and kill kargile. 
L/S rug, open compartment, get quillions.

The blade itself is syntax nightmare.

Go into mamakins cave, map and kill mamakin. South, play with the 
treasure for a while.

'take treasure' is the right syntax. And boy is it a pain in the arse. Theres 
really nothing to indicate in this room that the blade is here. Not that I 
could find. But its the only place left, if you've searched this quest area 
exhaustively.

Get blade, make sword, go to angelo, look at the statue, place sword, 
place cloak, place amulet.

You'll get 75qp and 'Protection of the Gods', an other with about as much 
ac as Dragon Shell.

Its oldskool undroppable ala quest item. The quest is repeatable. But note above about Cloak of Perplexus. Second time I tried to get a repeater, the Ghost of the King came down and took all my perplexus items because I was 'not involved' in killing Malisto. I was, but I wasn't the tank. (Nacage was)

Fin.


pyron


This is going to very choppy. I don't have a full solution. I wrote this stuff 
down, but like many documents, it is gone. 

To start the quest, you goto Tensors Hell. The northwest fork goes to 
tiamat, The Southeast fork goes to some mean little yummy gargoyles.

The other fork goes to Pyron.

Enter the doors, theres a sign suggesting you challenge pyron. So you do 
that.

You'll have to go through a bunch of puzzles, these save over reboots - to 
a point.. I think its a little bit buggy. Anyway. Go in there, challenge. Heres 
an outline for some of the puzzles. I can't even remember them all, so I 
can't write them all.

::BEFORE YOU START::

Every puzzle in this quest is instance based. What does that means? If 
you die, your eq is dested. Your progress is destroyed. The area unloads. 
In the case of the plates puzzle, and stuff like that - do it naked. You'll 
probably die. With spiders, do it in as much disposable good eq as you 
can manage, you'll probably die.

::THE PUZZLES::

Powder Keg puzzle. The map you're in is two rooms of three lengths, its a 
clock puzzle, so go to the room where they join and 'speak 3 o'clock'.

Spiders. Oh god. Oh god oh god oh god. You'd better hope you're 
prepared. This one is a maze, no looping dirs, plenty of hidden exits, and 
invisible little spiders. It kinda works like sludge in rloft. You cant fight 
back, you cant prevent it, and every few heartbeats it gets worse. Run 
round in a flurry, search the walls, keep it in a buffer so you can put it out 
quick. Theres two distinct sides to the map, on the other side is where the 
exit is. In a hidden room, there is a lever. Pull it.

Plates. Fuck me. This one sucks. You have to make two blades, one of 
story and one of legend. I don't know where you find out how this is done, 
I cheated, actually asked Carleon of all people. The story blade for me - 
and it does change, was iron. So you get the four iron plates, and 'fit' 
them to the openings in the walls. Then go to the opening at the end 
room and get the blade out, then put it on the pedestal. When you 
challenge a second time, and end up in here, you need to make the blade 
of legend, and that is always mithril plates. If you get it wrong, you die. So 
do this puzzle naked.

God Puzzle. The map is shaped like a crucifix. Go to the centre and pray.

Endless north/south loop room puzzle. Search the walls. You can go west 
on one of them.

Theres a bunch more that I can't remember. It wasnt all that long ago, 
sadly.

Anyway. Once they're all done, you can challenge Pyron. Hes 70k, and 
steals. He not just steals, but he steals then dests your eq. So if you're 
weapon dependant, take some basic ac to see how long it'll last, and take 
like. 50 Laser swords. Or whatever you need. Because he will destroy your 
weapon.

As a mage, it was a joke of a mob. As a bard, I had to do it with brute 
force from damagetypes my gobj was no suited to. Hes' wimpy safe by the 
way.

He does a lot of fire damage, but the true threat is the theft. After hes 
dead, push the button outside of his room. Hello quest points. 

IM me if you need help with the puzzles. You remind me what they are, and I'm sure the answers will come to me.

dragon knight


From forest portal it's: 3w, 2sw, 2s, 2e.Good luck trying
to map it.  The area is dotted with following wyverns,
which aren't hard to kill.  Object: free the queen
from being entombed in stone. To do this you need 5
colored orbs that you get from killing the dragon
knights, and the Staff of the Positive Plane to kill
the High Cleric who guards her. You also need a
hexagonal key and an octagonal key and a triangular key 
to get to her.  OK, go to green keep, kill guards (easy), 
ne, 2u, n, push stone (on pillar), get red key. Ignore 
all other items here. Go to red keep, west room, secret 
exit up, search soot for rusty key. Go
to blue keep, kill guards, n, w, search hearth, unlock
door (with rusty key), hearth, search look at brick, l
at symbols, push stone/button, get green key.  Go back
to green keep, 2n, nw, 2u, unlock door with green key,
n, there is a dragon knight here. Wait for a minute
and he will turn into a green dragon and attack. Kill
him (he's not too hard). Get the green orb.  
Never wimpy from a dragon knight or demons come
and attack you, and they are annoying.  Go to the 'wiz
tree'. There is something in the description about an
odd tree here. Search, turn knob, enter, u, and you
will see an elven wizard. Say help, and he will give
you a rainbow amulet. Wear this.  Go to red
stronghold. kill guards, 2n, ne, 2u, n, make sure
you're wearing the rainbow amulet, and enter. Make
sure nobody follows you in.  There is a pillar here.
Push stone, get blue key.  Leave the room and go down,
sw. This time go nw, 2u, unlock door with red key, n,
wait till dragon knight turns into dragon, kill him,
get red orb. Go to blue keep again, 2n, nw, 2u, unlock
door with blue key, n, and there is a bench here. Lay
on bench, dragon knight comes, kill blue dragon, get
blue orb. Go to village.  Follow the path into the
center of the village, and then the wise woman is off
to the nw. Go to her, and say help.  She will give you
a torch.  Leave the village and go to white keep. 
Kill guards, 2n and you see a fountain. 
Melt ice (need that torch). Get scroll. Go ne, 2u, n,
push stone (on pillar) and get black key. Go to black
keep. Kill guards, 2n, nw, 2u, unlock door with black
key, n, kill black dragon knight, get black orb.  Go
s, 2d, ne, 2u, n, kill cleric. Push stone (on pillar).
get white key.  If you enter the doorway here you will
go straight back to white keep. Go to white keep, 2n,
nw, 2u, unlock door with white key, n, kill dragon
knight, and get white orb. OK, now you should have all
the dragon orbs!  You need the more keys and the
staff: Go to wyvern nest, climb (up into nest).  Kill
all 4 wyverns, search nest and you should find the
staff of the positive plane. If not, go searching
around the cliffs for more nests. You can insert one
of the orbs into the staff, but don't try this right
now, because you'll lose the orb and will have to go
get another.  Go to lizard nest. Climb up, kill faerie
lizards, search nest and you should find a crystal key. 
If not search around for more nests.
Triangular Key: on peasant lord in village
Hexagonal Key: Go to place marked Temple on map,
search bushes, enter, look at murals, move brick, get
hexagonal key.
Octagonal Key: The octagonal key is on a courier who
wanders in the area.  I have always found him in the
north east section.  Follow him and kill him (easy).
Get octagonal key. 
When you're ready for the final assault on the palace,
look at the scroll. Chant the words on the scroll and
you end up at the cliff where you have to 'search
cliff' and go up. Actually, this place is 7n of the
portal of life, and you don't need the scroll at all
to get there.  Go up, n, kill lich, 2 or 3n, till you
see a pillar. Unlock pillar (with crystal key) and the
drawbridge comes down. Go north and into palace.  The
palace is basically a square, with a tower at each
corner. In each tower is a device you need to unlock
(using hex or octagonal key). When this happens the
pyramid they were supporting floats to the ground and
you can go in to free the queen.
What you do is: from just inside palace, go: w, kill
cleric (no wimpy, but he's not too hard), sw, up, kill
lich, (no wimpy), u, unlock device. 2d, ne, 2e, kill
cleric (no wimpy), se, up, now there is a lich here
who won't let you go up. Kill him, and you can go 2u,
unlock device, 2d, kill lich, nw, 2n, kill cleric (no
wimpy), ne, u, dispose of the lich, u, unlock device,
2d, sw, 2w (past a couple of clerics, but they allow
you to wimpy), nw, u, dispose of lich, u, unlock
device. Now all the devices are inactivated, and the
pyramid should come down. Go 2d, se, e, kill the 2
clerics, 2s, wield the staff of the positive plane,
kill cleric. He should vaporize with the first hit.
Get out all 5 orbs, look at the stone, and insert
orbs. When you do this, the queen is freed, and the
quest is done! 
Notes: If you let the lich follow you any further than
the base of the tower, then it will stop you leaving
and you will have to fight it to the death. The liches
take a while to kill, so they are annoying.  If you
have somebody as a tank in the palace, don't wield the
staff of the positive plane until you have to kill the
final cleric. If you are wielding the staff then
monsters will attack you, even if someone is trying to
defend.


evil god


Obviously, in all cases of larger quests, putz around a lot. This is THE BIG 
chaos quest and shouldn't be taken too lightly, even though it's fairly simple 
once you've completed it.

Find Tim Burton, who lives in the mansion in NW Darkmoor. He will tell you 
that he needs a Solution to his problems. You go into this cube he is carrying
then find and kill the Leviathon and get "A Solution". From nw/se room:
se,s,w,e. Come out of the box and give the Solution to Tim.  say There is no
solution to the puzzle box, the period fucks up the syntax(gay)
Tim thanks you  and tells you the cthulhuan priests keep bugging him to join
but he resists them. He tells you they gave him more information on a 
pamhplet, but he flushed it down the toilet.

Go to the TMNT sewer area. Enter the pipe and fing the Rat King. Go to where
 the turtles and the evil dudes are. Kill the evil dudes and find trapped April, 
who has a little key. Kill the good guys and get a chest. The key opens the 
chest and you get a Mutagen. With the Mutagen, you can find this sewer 
monster in the sewer maze(from rat king, ne, se, e). Spill the Mutagen on 
him. He will thank you and  give you his only possessions, a wallet and a 
pamphlet.

Now you head to R'lyeh. Find the Avatar & say hello. Once he's dead, you will 
hear Cthulhu's voice. Also take the ring, you need this to pick up the artifact.
He invites you to try to kill him and that you will need an unholy artifact to do
so. An invisible object is cloned to you, signifying that you have been invited.
You must now find this artifact.

Go to the temple underneath the graveyard in Darkmoore,dig with the shovel
until you get dragged under, climb staircase, up, kill priest to get the artifact.

Now you have to find the statue of Cthulhu(3e2s2en8e2n2ed2s from coc) in 
Darkmoor and put the artifact on the statue. If you haven't been invited, the 
artifact will be destroyed and you will have to start over. If you have been 
invited, the statue will glow and you can push it.

Go down and follow the rooms until you reach a maze. The maze is made up
 of 12 identical rooms. Rooms 6-12 have 3 random exits and 1 correct exit. 
Rooms 0-5 have 4 random exits. Random exits range from room0-room8. If
 you search in maze5.c you find a pair of lips. The lips tell you to give them 
what they 'need, beautiful one.' If you french the lips, they will suck the 
blood from your tongue. You will go to 1hp and finally break free. Then the 
lips tell you that in order to get through the maze, you must convert the 
name of a one-legged daemon servant of Cthulhu into numbers. This 
servant is found in Pandaemonium.

You must then find a chart on the wall of maze3.c which tells you the N=3 
S=2 E=4 and W=1. So the player can then convert the daemon's name 
(Kardaak) into 3124113, and then from the beginning of the maze proceed 
NWSEWWN. Once you do this you will find yourself at a dead end. The dead 
end has a huge mural on it. There is a pile of rubble in the corner. When you
search (needs to be searched several times) it you will find a note. The note
reads "I passed this wall and lived. Mr. Clean." Go to Mr. Clean.

He is interactive and will tell you he will give you instructions on how to pass 
the wall in return for something to help him clean the floors. Go to ripper
area (3e, all north from coc) and go to the ne corner and "search edge"
if you don't have enough room in your inv. you will drop the mop and need
to wait for a reset Give the mop to Mr. Clean and he gives you a scroll telling 
you that you must find 2 images on the wall's mural which are distinctly 
different. Then you must depress them and speak the names of the figures. 
Go back to the mural.

Check (body part) until you figure out that there are two figures without belly 
buttons. The figures therefore represent Adam and Eve. Depress the images 
and 'speak' the names adam and eve and then the wall will click open 
revealing it can be pushed open like a revolving door. Note: if you hesitate 
more than 20 heartbeats between depressing the images and speaking the 
first name or between the two names or if you leave the room after the 
images have been depressed or if you 'speak' anything other than adam or 
eve, the maze will collapse and anyone in it will most likely die and the maze
 will be closed off for the rest of the reboot. There will be a warning in the 
scroll stating that there shold be no hesitations and not to say anymore than
 necessary.

After the door is unlocked you can push it open. Only one person may push 
it per reset and that player is move_playered so no one may follow. You are 
moved into a room with Cthulhu. Kill him and you solve the quest.

balooga falls

Notes: 
-The angeldemon Megaera turns you into stone and you can't do anything but quit and lose everything you have permanently
-The room with a curtain to pull covering a cage inside the cave is a trap that turns you into stone, same as before(quit/lose everything)


Okay. For starters. Go into Balooga, and talk to nyrow. He's one room 
west. Hi, Job, Quest, Angeldemons, the whole deal.

He'll tell you to talk to the priest if you truly want to help. Follow the 
Roads. This is important. Travel in verbose and follow the roads. Go to the 
church, its on the south side of balooga, accessed through the main 
courtyard, east of the south exit. I lost my map soon after I finished 
making it, so I have no dirs for you.

Say all the usual stuff. And she will mention praying to gnos, to get the 
quest started. I dont know what this really achieves, if anything, or where 
you find out the right room to do it in, I just 'pray to gnos' in every room. 
Its due west of the courtyard, on the road. Im sure theres something in 
the room to indicate the room is particuarly religious, but I didn't look.

Now head into the pub, and search the bench. Open it up for a map. Take 
a gander. Search the painting. It mentions the library that you need to go 
into. The whole point of this quest is the library. Go into the centre of the 
courtyard, fiddle around with the monument, try and make it dance. It 
wont achieve anything, but you are a thorough questor after all. When 
you're finished goofing around, Go to Lars, on the west side of town, and 
buy all his stuff. Buy balls, stilts, and barrel.

Head into the north outbacks, none of the Angeldemons around here are 
too dangerous, but you will be jumped by them, so be prepared.

Look/search river in every room. Only one room is safe to enter the river. 
It'll say so. 'wade river'. 'climb into barrel'. And wait.

The prayer from earlier allows you to survive the fall. So now you're in a 
cavern system behind the waterfall. Kill the caveman, scorpion, and stuff, 
wnader around all questy like. Don't worry about the room with the polls 
yet, or the locked door (killing the guards will get you the key). Go in the 
locked door if you feel like, but don't say 'free'. Just look at him. Note his 
presence etc.

Your first questy stop should be an old man, in the northern section of the 
caves, who will ask you not to kill him, as he is your ally. He has 
information. Quiz him extensively, then start doing questing stuff.

You'll need nine gems for the Library.

The first one is north,west,north of the ogre guards. Search goblet. Its 
safe. Theres a broken trap in this room that a previous adventurer has 
sprung. The jewel is in the goblet.

The second is in an idol. Climb idol, its just north of the caveman. A bunch 
of disciples will attack you. Blick them, up you go, get the pry an eye out. 
For me it was left. Right did damage.

The third is in the pit. You'll see a pit with a rope in it. It says jump for 
rope, but theres also a wooden box with a message from Mos saying not 
to blindly type commands. So I jumped the pit. Death trap? Eh. Climb 
down the pit from the other side, and theres a gem down the bottom. 
Climb back up.

Go into the throne room, and get the parchment from the skeleton and 
read it. Gives hints on things to do. Search the arms of the throne, one of 
them has a gem in it.


Go to the mirror demon room. If I recall, to get to the demon, you need to 
go through the poles room. Theres something past the poles room that 
was important. This is all a bit hazy. Anyway, the syntax is walk between 
poles. I dont know what happens if you do the other thing. Kill the demon. 
Smash mirror. Gem there. Make sure you've read the parchment first.

**There was no gem for me but instead a north exit appeared and there was a "magicstik" in there.
This magicstik gave me a heat protection that let me get into the west/north area of the cavern.**


In the northern section of the map is a room with a skull in it. Throw the 
wooden balls at the skull. Says in their long descript they'd be good for 
breaking a skull. Gem.

Theres one in the northern trap past the room. By the way, going north or 
south from there springs a trap. 'pray to gnos' and be saved. Search the 
walls for a gem.

Leprechaun. Go to the leprechaun and kill it. It runs away after a 
while. 'search something', 'enter gap'. This room is designed to be syntax 
nightmare. Make mistakes if you want to maintain your integrity. I don't 
think quests really get snooped any more.. But eh, it was only solved last 
week. Could be a good idea. Kill the leprechaun again, get his ring. Look 
at the ring, get gem from ring. 'rub stalagmite' to get out. Again, its a 
syntax nightmare room. Fiddle.

The final one is in a hole. Theres a rockbadger or something. You'll know 
what I mean when you see it. Kill it, enter hole. Kill again, search about, 
and you get the obsidian one.

Alternate Locations:
   In the room with the cage with a curtain over it.  After you've read the parchment, go in and 'avert eyes'.
  Then pull rope or pull curtain to remove the curtain from the cage.  A gorgon comes out and you kill it. Gem in corpse.

Theres other things to do, Im not entirely sure what the point is. Clues of 
some kind I guess. I never got the flood room. Theres a room with a door 
that you can open, you go in, and it suggests you say something. say 
gnos, and the room floods. pray to gnos so you don't drown. Leave. 
Theres a light to enter, I think you have to have drowned first. Step into it 
for some theme-y stuff. It didnt help me. And lastly theres the old man in 
a (door) room. Talk to him, and he'll help you out if you free his son. 
Remember the prisoner from earlier? Unlock the door, say free. He'll ask if 
you want anything else before he goes. Say proof, or dad.  I made the 
mistake of freeing him without knowing about the father. Had to wait for a 
repop. Give the medallion proof to the old man and he'll talk about the 
manticore. Give the manticores name, and his.

Go north to the manticore, its through the crush trap. Fire it, pray to gnos, 
go north again. Talk to him, say his name, Byron or something. I forget. 
You got told it a few lines ago. Write it down. He'll want to know who told 
you, say the other thing. And then he'll let you pass if you say what sacred 
quest you're on. This is syntax nightmare. I got help. The proper syntax 
is 'say defeat the false god'. Completely crap. Try everything, then solve it 
at your leisure. Go past him, and you're at the gem room.

**The old man asks if your here to defeat the false god**(if snooped)

This room is not a trap at all of any kind. Fill all 9 holes with gems, as per 
syntax supplied in the room. Pull the lever, and it'll tell you how many you 
got right. Fire up notepad, and jot down ones that you're sure are right. 
You wont be given any outward indicator at all. Nail the door. And in you 
go. You'll eventually meet Gnos himself in the library.

Theres a painting in there. Search everything, especially the whores hand, 
crystal, sun, etc. After you've exhausted everything, search moon. Now you 
can step into the painting and talk to Gnos. He'll give you a staff with 21 
gems on it, protect you with the tears of gnos, and tell you to kill the 21 
angel demons.

He'll say not to pray to him and ask for the tears or he will forsake you. So 
don't do it at all. The tears are automatic. They stop all the balooga 
specials, turning all of the angeldemons into harmless 70k mobs. Mow 
them down, and now, this is important: MODIFY YOUR CORPSE TRIGGER.

Before processing the corpse, 'remove heart', followed by 'touch heart'. Kill 
all the angeldemons. Here's a checklist.

1. Megaera
2. Muse
3. Vacuo
4. Spirino
5. Cyprus
6. Leah
7. Lanusa
8. Greyfox
9. Guacamole
10. Atalanta
11. Alecto
12. Python
13. Minos
14. Clarapcyche
15. Echo
16. Pyro
17. Furious
18. Billirubin
19. Nimrod
20. Nitro
21. Chronos

The staff has a screw thread on it, just like the hole you found at the 
monument. Kill the 21 angeldemons, light up the 21 gems, screw in the 
staff to the base. It'll summon the False God. He's only 70k. Bash it.



wayhaven


Old info. Dunno how out-of-date it might be.

First, map wayhaven ;)

Go to the Clerk (from portal: 5e,5s,e,climb stairs),
present yourself, and he'll tell you you need citizenship.


Go to the stall n,w of portal, enter stall, buy guitar.


Go to woman on balcony, 6n,2e (hidden entrance) of portal.
Serenade woman, and receive her message.

Go to captain of the guard... from portal: 4s, climb staircase.
Deliver message. He gives you a message.

Go back to woman on balcony, deliver message. She gives you a note.


Go to guild master: from woman, go: e,2n,w,enter door, w, present note.
He gives you guild sponsorship.

Go back to wayhaven clerk, present yourself. He tells you you need
a bounty hunter's license.

Go to tintorillos, w,s of clerk, 'prepare document, and they tell you
that you need ink and notarized paper.

Go to ink shop, from tintorillos, it's: n,w,5n,7e,2n,2e,3n,4w,2n,e.
Ink master tells you that you need an ink fish.
>From here, go:w,n,4w,s,kill fisherogre, get rod, catch fish.
Go back to ink master and buy ink.

Go to paper shop: from ink shop, it's: w,n,3w,4n. Buy legal bond paper.
You now need it notarized. From Clerk, go back 3w, 2 or 3s and there is a sign
saying that the notary office is along the promenade. If you try to go s,e
you'll find you can't... you need a pass. Go to printer shop: from portal,
it's 12e, 2n, 2e, 2n, w , and try and buy pass. he tells you to go to a forger,
and to 'shimmy on out of here'. Type 'shimmy' and you go up a ladder to where the forger is (lame, eh?). Try and buy a pass, but you need special ink
and paper. Go to the ink shop and buy the ink, and the paper shop
stocks the paper. Come back with these, and then you can get a pass.

Go back to the promenade: from portal, it's: 5e,5s,w,3s, then go 3e to
the notary office, and 'notarize document'. You'll soon find you can't leave
the promenade again. east, north of the notary office is a place where
if you search the dock you'll see a boat. Leap to boat, free smuggler,
and he'll row you across the river, and also give you a whistle that won't
work, but you'll need later.

Go back to tintorillos and 'prepare document'. Now you need signatures.
Go to clerk, then go south. If you type 'sign document', the councilman
says he needs a bribe to sign it. There are 5 councillors you need to get
to sign, and they all need different bribes.
1: a gem, kill a dwarf in wayhaven and get it (there are usually dwarven
   traders in the northern section near the guild.)
2: a gladhand: kill a hustler in the se section of wayhaven and get it
3: a special book on how to make money: get from the library.
   From portal, go: 7w,3s,2e,2s,u,w, kill everyone here, and steal book.
   (you'll notice the book if you search the shelves).
4: A drow tapestry.. this is the hardest to get. Go to the gunpowder shop
in far ne wayhaven (s,3e,n of paper shop). Buy gunpowder. Go to citadel cannon
4s,2w,3s of portal, light cannon, climb in cannon. You'll be shot into
the citadel (and take massive damage).
Go through the citadel and kill the guards as you go (they won't let you past)
In the captain's room, kill the captain, and you'll notice a haze in the room
Step in haze, and you get tported into the citadel walls. Kill the guards,
climb up, kill guards, and head west. Kill the guards as you go, except
for two points along the wall where you'll see sergeants that will
let you past without you killing them. 
When you get to the captain DO NOT ATTACK HIM.
Look at him and say bribe, say key. He'll tell you he wants a deck of cards.  Leave the area by going all east/down/nw wich brings you to
the southeast tower.  Find a gambler for the deck of cards.
Give the cards to the captain and he gives you key. keep going west, and
then north. A couple of rooms north, if you search, you'll find the drow
tapestry, steal it, and give it to the appropriate councillor.
5: The last councillor wants a silver dragon scale. Go to the challenge
arena (from portal, 4n,e,d) challenge the baby silver dragon, which
is in the southern room. Kill it and get its scale.

Once you've got all the councillor's signatures on the document, then the
document is complete. Go back to clerk and present yourself again.
He tells you about the quest, and says the madam in the brothel is
linked to the corruption. Go to the brothel. From portal, it's:
8e,3s, 3e, 2n, e. You have to peruse the book, and request a whore.
The Eunuch tells you that you need to be a guild member to use the brothel.

Go to the guild HQ: from portal it's: 8n, 5e, 2n, e. Request guild membership.
Buy thread from Eustace the Haberdasher in 11 or so north of the portal and east/northward and velvet from appropriate stalls in the bazaar (s,w; and s,e of
portal), and go to seamstress (from portal, she's: 12e, 2n, 2e, 7n, and
order a sash.

Go back to brothel, Order a whore and pleasure, him/her ;)
Then you can request the madam. Kill the madam (don't pleasure her!)
When you attack she escapes through a secret door. search, push catch, and
go through the secret door, kill madam, get the papers and the key.
sr until you get the board, push board or soemthing to leave.

Now you need to go to the chief mugger.
Go to the mews. From portal, go: 5e,4n,e,3s,e, kill the first mugger here,
and he carries a dwarf mask. Go back w,3n, 4w,s,e,s, wear mask, now you
can go east into the dwarven pub. About 5 dwarves attack at once, so be
careful! Kill them, then search the mirror, and find a trap door down.
Go down into the sewers. Go n, e, search around here and you'll find a
do
or in the south wall. With the key you got from the madam you can open the
door.

When you enter the mugger chief attacks, Kill him. Search around and
get his seal, and you'll also find a secret way out that takes you
back to the safe part of the mews (just north of entrance).

Go back to the clerk and present yourself. He'll tell you to go
see the mayor. When you try and enter the mayor's office, you'll
fall into a trap and begin to drown. Blow the whistle you have!
The smuggler will come and rescue you. He'll take you to a secret
entrance to the mayor's office. Search the ladder (to disarm a trap).
Climb up and kill mayor. Quest is then done! Don't search a chest here...
you'll just take damage.

Rastafan has some info in his .Plan.

There is talk of a time when the balance prevailed.  Where neither good
nor evil had hold of the land.  The bringers of that Balance were
The Grand Druid, Krilmrond, and his battle companion Shokin.

Many years ago the evil demon goddess Gorum Dorion trapped Krilmrond's soul and
imprisoned Shokin in everlasting anguish.  Krilmrond has been unable to
free himself or his friend for fear of never regaining his soul.

Gorum Dorion holds them both so that some day she can force their allegience
in the battle against Taramin in his attempt to take over the known planes
of existence.  His power is great, and though he is the descendent of both
Krilmrond and Gorum Dorion, they cannot stand against him alone.  Together,
with Gorum Dorion forcing Krilmronds allegience they can defeat his evil.
Until such a time when Taramin is no longer a threat, Krilmrond's fate is
sealed.

If you can secure the release of Krilmrond's soul and defeat the threat
that looms over the lands, ultimate glory will be yours.

Be wary in your attempt, for your quest will take you through planes
of existence not meant for mere mortals to tread.

durskaen


This is the True staff 'Durskaen'. One of the few remaining Storm Blades
known to exist. It is a long, unusually sturdy staff. Upon the end
is a crescent moon shaped blade, in honor of the deity Hecate. Suspended
magically within the blade is a glowing orb, representative of the moon
and all the power that dwells in the darkness. This orb pulsates with
energy in a frightening manner. Along the shaft of the weapon are
dozens of short, sharp spikes. These spikes match the calloused hands
of the Storm Legion Member whose staff this is. Anyone else that were
to wield this weapon would certainly injure themselves trying.
This item is bound to you.
This weapon is in excellent condition.
It looks heavy.


The smith is:
s2e2se3nwn2w5n2e4n from Ghoti

say storm blades to him, he doesnt really talk about much

a sword is at: 
s, 2e, all south, east, a few north, just search rubble in each room until
carrion crawlers come out, the black one is NASTY. Once killing all of them, you'll reach the sword.


Other item may be dragon orb:
Guardian Dragon says: Hmm, obviously you don't have the items then.
     Well, seeing as you asked I'll be polite enough to answer.
     To qualify, you must have the Key to Heaven and the Lock
     from the Gates of Hell. Thus, the ancient cycle starts again.
????

Other item may be a staff. So staff+sword+orb.


The syntax to make Durskaen is 'assemble durskaen' at Ameragu.

What was the clue for who Visek is?

-You say: symbol
Dahilirant speaks: Rare is the fortitude required for travel along the path.
                   The inventor Visek might be of some assistance to you.
> say visek
You say: visek
The god speaks: I do not know what has become of the inventor.  His mortal time
                has long since passed, though his home might house some aid.
> say home
You say: home
The Prince of Lies nods.
Dahilirant speaks: Visek was rumored to live on a remote island south of
                   this desert isle.(taslen)

Ahh right. in one of the rooms along the souther boarder of taslen you 
can see in the distance some things in the ocean. They're turtles and 
There's a whistle or someway to call one to carry you out to an island.

i've been searching taslen, i found the turtles and many other sub areas
and a marble (woo) but no whistle, do you recall anything about getting this
whistle?

I'm trying to recall.... Have you tried talking to George Weathermay? Or perhaps you have to search the floor where you find George's name....

with george weathermay, i found a charm that initially let me into the area with the hourglass.  weathermay gives the symbol that opens the door into it, asides from that piece with george i have nfc what else i can do.  still tryiong to find that whistle, anything you recall?

I don't recall exactly how you get it. Have you tried talking to Dahilirant about  Turtles or the island?

**Anyone remember how to get off the island once you get to Visek?  Blowing the whistle again doesn't work.**

Dahilirant speaks: Beware he of the black orchid.
-anyone know what this could mean?



Where are you at in this quest? I've recently did a walk though it again and 
am refreshed with knowledge.


** Update 12/13/05 - 5th Ranger Location.
Update: 6th Ranger location, additional magic match location

Alrighty then, Keylon Crown solution. Written in 2004.

The object of the quest, find Keylontalist's Crown. The Prize, 100 quest 
points. It's a big quest that can be done over multiple boots. If you're 
reading this, you've probably already tried to cheat on Keylon Crown before 
and been frustrated with 10 year out of date info, so take the quest slow-
ish, and if you run into someone in hidden rooms, continue another day. 
Like various solutions already widely distributed, they all recommend to do 
the quest in sections over several days, as every permanently saved item 
you get is timed and logged. ;)

The major locations below are listed for speedwalks and such, a lot of 
these mobs have bootrun items. Maps in Portal are available upon request

                              Keylon Crown Solution
                              =====================


Part 1: Seal of Keyloncia and Scroll of Knowledge
-------------------------------------------------

First things first, you need a Seal of Keyloncia so you can do the quest. Its 
mentioned in the quest description. So go to Castle Keylon, in the City of 
Keyloncia and have a word with Sayrena, Queen fo Keyloncia.

Say: hi, job, quest, keylon, paladin, honor, salinsha, hurinteon, desaren, 
crown, altar
 
When you say 'quest' you recieve the Seal of Keyloncia. This saves all of 
the quest critical items, and notes that you have found items that are 
needed but not saved. Several items don't make it to the seal at all. 
Hurinteon's key, and Tyler the Boy's key are two found items that get on 
the seal but don't save from boot to boot.

Visit Salinsha, hidden in the same city. Dirs above.
Say: hi, job, quest, paladin, honor, keylon, sayrena, brother, hurinteon, 
birth

Visit Hurinteon, he is in the city of Raric.
Say: hi, job, mage, quest, help, gods, power, scroll

Go fetch the Scroll of Knowledge. e, 2d, w, leave, 2ne, relax, vortex, 2u, n, 
say knowledge.

** If ever questioned how you do this section, the relax entrance is 
mentioned in the long description of the entrance room, in the town 
proper. **

You now have the seal of Keyloncia, found item Hurinteon's key, seal item 
Scroll of knowledge.

To see the scroll of knowledge; type sknowledge. It's a translator for 
Koricu in Zolifo, and Satarus in Razorin. Make sure you use the bloody 
thing, dispite me including translations in the solution.

Part 2: The Scroll of Water Breathing, The Gem of True Seeing
-------------------------------------------------------------

Go to Devil's Isle. Push 1 from most travelers. Porih is the closest to the 
ferry. Leave the traveller and visit Durantalist the Master Thief.
Say: hi, job, quest, etc. Eventually he mentions a gem.
say: gem, pond, scroll, sabrena

Visit Sabrena on the same island. You will have to try and go north through 
Sabrena's barrier many times. Sometimes hundreds. Open the door, up 
the stairs, have a chat.
Say: hi, job, quest, mage, scroll, water

She wants the secret to the Runesword
Say: runesword

She will mention one of the three Runesword carrying NPC's will know the 
secret. Tanary Treeheart in Razorin, Sholitia in Zolifo, or Poritha in 
Wexsmuck.

Tanary Treeheart: 5s, 2e, s, 2e, 2se, e from Razorin Entrance
Poritha Someone: enter, move torches, 2n, nw, w from Wexsmuk Entrance
Sholitia the Unseen Thief/Mage: say [charactername], w, 2n, 2e, n 

Visit the right NPC,
Say: runesword, secret

The word is 'chargesword'.

Return to Sabrena and say: Chargesword

** In the old quest you could just say chargesword. Now visiting the correct 
NPC is nescessary.

You get the Scroll of Water Breathing. Return to the traveller. open scroll, 
2e, hack brushes with  (ie, hack bushes with axe), 2n, 
read scroll, enter pond, dive, dive, dive, get gem, surface

** You don't have to be wielding the edged weapon for this to work. **

You now have the Gem of True Seeing, the second permanent Seal item.

Part 3: Map to the Forest of Illusion
-------------------------------------

I have no fucking idea why this item is nescessary. It doesn't do shit, so 
far as I can tell. The dirs to the cup do not change from from character to 
character, or boot to boot. They have been the same for 10 years. I think 
the Cup of Lucanus isn't on the altar in the forest if you don't have the 
map. This has happened to me before, but there was also a player in the 
forest at the time. They might have just picked it up, blowing that theory 
out of the water.

I suspect most players who have solved Keylon honestly, or have at least 
tried, found the Cup like I did. Mapping the looping dirs the hard way with 
gold coins and other garbage items.

Anyway. Now to get the map.

You need to speak to a ranger. He loads in 4 locations that I am aware of. 
If he loads in more, you will have to find him yourself. His name starts with 
P. Patheon or something. Im writing this document offline, but you'll know 
the guy when you see him.

1: City of Raric, Southeast fork.
2: Town of Porih, an empty house, the entrance is hidden.
3: Town of Waff, in the only empty house.
4: City of Razorin, one of the trees, east side.
5: Town of Flinia, in one of the spare rooms of the merchants house.
6: Keyloncia, upstairs in the castle on the east side

Dirs are in the first section of the quest. After you've found him,
Say: hi, job, quest, travel, no (to the ogre question)

Goto Zolifo, the guard will ask you your name. Say your characters name in 
English, not Ogrish. Visit Koricu.

The first thing Koricu says in english is:
'Piss off. What Want you? Ogrish speak to me!

Response to 'name' in ogrish.
'I am Koricu. Now Get of my face

Go back to our wayward ranger, wherever he may be. Say 'yes'. You don't 
need to ask about travel again. He will follow you. Drag him to Koricu and 
the ranger will avenge his parents, blicking Koricu. Then he will give you 
the Forest of Illusion map, tip his hat and bugger off. 

Part 4: The Mirror of Fate
--------------------------

Goto the city of Razorin, and visit Satarus the Lizard King. Try to go south 
from him and he will stop you.

Say: ocddr [hello]
Satarus Says: Kschp dbvhynbko B ochy qrz. Jcdbibzhzbrfk oxghf.
Satarus Says: Speak lizardish I hear you. Felicitations human.

Say: krxzo [south]
Satarus says: Krxzo lbdd B dcz ar qrx, bj cqck rj zoc nyharf qrx abtc zr gc.
Satarus says: South will I let go you, if eyes of the dragon you give to me.

Say: cqck [eyes]
Satarus says: H nyharf aychz hfn mdxc zoc cqck ohk.
Satarus says: A dragon great and blue the eyes has.
 
Say: nyharf [dragon]
Satarus says: Fra. Nyharf ohk cqck. Abtc gc zoc cqck rj zoc nyharf.
Satarus Says: Nog. Dragon has eyes. Give to the eyes of the dragon.

Now leave Razorin, and tear arse all across serinth looking for a Rare Black 
Flower. It could load in any of the rooms in the basic continent area of 
Serinth. I used to note the locations, but I cannot find them at this exact 
second. It's on the basic continent area. If you can be bothered, visit 
Bryontic without the flower, and he'll lessen your search area. Get the 
flower.

Now visit the Dragon Isle, where Bryontic Lives. Don't give bryontic the 
flower until he tells you to. If you just give him the flower you'll have to 
wait an hour for it to repop. Or kill the 1.9m classed bastard and genesis 
the sucker.

Visit Bryontic and,
Say: hi, job, quest, eyes, give, flower
Give: the flower

Go to Satarus the Lizard King, and give the king the eyes.
Satarus says: Qrx zohfpk abtc B. Qrx krxzo ghq ar khjcdq frl.
Satarus says: You thanks give I. You south may go safely now.

Go south, get the boots,
2n, 3d, nw, 2s, e, wear boots (it's classed as an other), 2s, se

Look at and search the tree. Correct syntax you can bloody work out yourself. Get the pouch.

Go to the town of Flinia.

** I would recommend doing this section backwards. Visiting the boy, 
meeting the merchant, having a chat, then divising a way of making the 
merchant tell the truth. That's if you care what wizards think of you, if it 
ever comes into question. **

Visit Tyler the Boy.
Say: key

** You can say other stuff if you want to. But you don't need to. **

You get the key marked as found on your seal. The item doesnt save however.

s, 2w, unlock door, open door, 4n

Say: hi, job, quest, etc

The lying merchant always says they know nothing about anything.
'sprinkle powder' on this young whipper snapper and rince repeat.

Say: hi, job, quest, merchant, cities, ships, vitaca

He will tell you about his hidden traveler to the Island of Vitaca.

Visit the Village Ruins of Vitaca.

2n, e, search, l tree, search tree, l branch, search branch, pull branch, 3n, 
search rubble

** Get explored rooms on this island anyway. Theres another 10 flavour 
rooms. **

You will get a key to the locked door one south of here. In you go.

Search the picture and it's an illusion. Walk through it and follow the dirs 
through n, e and use your Gem of True Seeing (truesee) and the Mirror of 
Fate appears. Gaze mirror and you'll be presented with a riddle. Google for 
the solution. They're just stock riddles. I don't know how many there are, I 
suspect theres more than one, I've always got the same riddle with a 
variety of characters.

My answer is heroine. [He, Her, Hero, Heroine]

Gaze in the mirror again and a vision will be shown to you. There are two 
important bits of information in this vision. First is the magic word to meet 
Saleyic (pazak). And the second is the name of a craftsman (dynixen). I 
literally searched Serinth for months trying to find out this Craftsman's 
name. It was only a chancey moment of unparrallelled boredom that made 
me re-read a log of the Mirror of Fate vision and there it was staring me in 
the face. The rest of the story is filler. This is a kickarse quest though, so 
read the bloody thing.


Part 5: Dorthinick and The Cup of Lucanus
--------------------------

Go to the Tower of Desaren. Look at the sign in the first room

T O O P
E N G A
T E P U
S H

[To open gate push]

Push Gate.

Head up to Saleyic's room. On the level below him theres some rubble 
stopping your climb. Move rubble. Also move it on the way back down. If 
you don't do it on the way up, you won't get all the way up. If you don't do 
it on the way down, you goto the basement. Say Pazak up the top, as in 
the vision.

Wait a tic.

Say hi, job, quest, cup, bless

Saleyic will send you on a merry journey to get the Cup of Lucanus. So go 
get it. It's in the Forest of Illusion. The cup is on an altar. Try and grab it, 
you'll be presented with a riddle. My answer was 'anchor'. A stock google 
solvable riddle. Grab the cup and go back to Saleyic. Ask him to bless it for 
you. He'll need his holy symbol first.

Cup of Lucanus: e, ne, se, s, s, sw, w, se, e, ne, s, s, e
                w, n, n, sw, w, nw, e, ne, n, n, nw, sw, w, leave

It's in the ivory keep.

Go to Keylon and kill some guards or whatever, grab two items from their 
corpses. Then go to the Ivory Keep.  Pick a rose from one of the rooms in 
the keep garden, then press the rose into the rose shaped symbol to 
enter the keep. Theres two rooms north and south in the keep. Drop an 
item in each. It doesn't matter what they are, or how much they weigh. Any 
two expendable items will do. The weight of these items will open a 
pressure door. In you go, and theres a candle on an altar that you need to 
light. You need a magical match. Go tear the continent upside down 
looking for it.

Theres five locations that I am aware of.

1. The old mousehouse in Desaren's Ruined Tower. 
In the room west of the up exit into the tower, examine the hole. search it, reach for coin

2. Another location in Desaren's Ruined tower. Theres a room on the same 
level where you feel ghosts tapping your shoulder and such. e, n from the 
mousehole. Search all of the walls in the room, and if the west wall looks 
to be a new construction you can bust through it. In the room is a three 
legged table, and a picture of a three legged table with matches on it. 
Search the table -legs- and you'll find a box of matches holding up a short 
leg.

3. Zolifo Castle. In King Brytex's room. Search all of the artworks. Theres a 
pack of matches inside one of the paintings.

4. Sopem. Theres a room full of runes, if the box of matches is in there 
you can trace the runes. If it isn't there, you'll just get frustrated.  Trace 
the runes, and a single magical match appears on the floor. 

5. Sopem. In the crystals room near the well. Search the crystals, presto, 
magical match.

Head back to the Ivory Keep. Light the candle, and a circle of light 
appears. Enter the circle and behold, an altar with the holy symbol 
appears. Grab at it, another stock google riddle. Solve the sucker, get the 
symbol, head back to Saleyic.

Ask him to bless your stupid cup.

He'll send you on a ridiculous side quest to save Dorthinick the Death 
Knight's soul. So visit Dorthinick.

So save the poor sod. Go visit him. He's in sopem. Sleep on the altar and 
you'll eventually port into a dungeon. Theres a door here that can't be 
opened. See the bottom of this solution for more on the door. There's also 
a button on the south wall. Push it, and the east/west walls will start 
coming into to crush you. Look/search the east wall to activate spikes as 
an object. Then search spikes, many times, I do it in a batch of 10, to 
isolate a single spike. Then look at that spike, and push it. The walls will 
retract and you'll be dropped into Sopem. To the south is a well, your way 
out, and a room full of crystals - a possible magic match location. To the 
north is a dead end. Search around the bricks and you'll find a loose one. 
You can both push and pull this brick. I forget which command does what. 
Push/Pull will open an east west exit, only one is open at a time. Keylon 
Cown qlist specifies no combat required to solve. West has blocking mobs, 
so that's not the way. East leads to Dorthinick. Say all the normal stuff and 
he'll rabbit on about a lich and power and such. Ask him about power and 
he'll offer to tell you a story. Listen up. It doesn't really say much of 
anything about anything, in fact, I found the story extremely misleading. I 
spent god knows how long talking to Salinsha and Hurinteon trying to 
make them talk about Dorthinick. I recommend talking to them 
regardless, just to generate attention. They do speak about it, but nothing 
useful at all. As I said, very misleading. They're not essential at all to this 
part of the quest. Anyway. Head over to the town of Pieb after hearing 
Dorthinick's story and check out the statue in the middle. If you've heard 
the story you can search the statue's arm, then break it. If you've not 
heard the story, nothing works.

If you break the arm, a spell gets cast on you allowing you to enter a 
secret room in this town, due south. You can see the room with the gem, 
but not enter unless you play with the statue.

Enter the secret room, and truesee in the room. Theres a message on the 
wall, and a golden flask. The message says if you speak the craftsman's 
name, you can take the flask. The craftsman's name is Dynixen.

** If asked about where you found the name; Mirror of Fate vision. He 
made Keylontalist's Sword. **

Grab the flask.

** Visit dorthinick and try to make him do something with the flask. It's 
useless and unnesscessary. Do it anyway. **

Visit Saleyic, and ask him to bless your stupid cup again. Bam. Blessed.

6. Getting your quest points
----------------------------

Drop down to Desaren's Basement and head on over to the portal. Run 
into it and get zapped for 200 hp or so, just for the sake of it. Then drink 
the cup. Enter the portal. Theres two rooms in there, one of them has a 
skeleton with a big shiny crown on its head. Grab that crown, buh-bo you 
need to speak the owners truename. Not a big ask. 'Speak Keylontalist 
Starwin'. It's not case sensitive. Visit the room one north of Queen 
Sayrena, in the City of Keyloncia. Place crown on altar. Bam.

7. Serinth Mysteries
--------------------

Fill me in if you know the answers to these ones. They're not parts of the 
current quest.

1. The door in Castle Wexsmuck. Theres a hidden door in there with no 
way of opening it. I suspect this area simply isn't finished. Never has been, 
never will be. If anyone knows how to get in there, I want to know about it.

2. Theres a door in Sopem locked from the outside. You wind up inside. I 
suspect theres absolutely nothing beyond it. Mythical rooms that don't 
actually exist. If anyone figures out how to get in there, I want to know 
about it.



miritar


NW,e,NE,n,NE,hack underbrush,d,NE,e,NE,2e to get to the mage to start it.  Talk to him for a while, then kill him and get the book from the bookshelf.  
You'll need to explore murus faralain and search a bunch in each room to discover hidden items in some of the rooms, the silver key is important.
When you find the tower, talk to the veteran adventurer, then go buy a long
ladder from wayhaven, go back and 'climb ladder'.  To stop the dragons you'll need to have a partner on the opposing side of the tower.  You'll find you can't 
go higher than this.  So go down into the faunist area, explore it and you'll find a room with a Dragonne on the ground (9n8e2n6ene from bottom under bushed)
, search it and get the jar. Open jar at the tower, 'rub goop on hands', climb 
ladder, go up, and now you can use the silver key to unlock the door.  Examine 
the room, and on the trusses/center you'll see a hook.  You need to go to 
etheral tower, the room with the woman, 'free woman', then exa chain/sr 
link/yank chain.  This you use to attach to the hook and 'climb chain' to cross.
Chain breaks, you end up on the platform with a beholder and a coffin. Kill the
beholder and you can play with the coffin, point of interest is the finger.


ravenloft


Any idea where:
The second holds fast to the first, joining in glory.
This is in the mother's place.
may be?



This quest involves 4 items, a hilt, longsword(Special one), icon, and chip.
the gypsy will tell you where you can find them, if it isn't there someone 
took it already and you are screwed unless they sell it to a shop or something.  Go to donavan and kneel, get the key in the room.  Then go to
the gypsy and nod.
so at the gypsy choose sun for the sword locations, and i think choose faith
for the chip/icon. 
this is what location correlates with what the gypsy says.
You see a beast in guard of the relic.-werewolf in cell area(by debbie)
Wickedness surrounds the artifact, hags of evil.-witch room by cats/portrait
You see veils of mist, ringing in your ears.-skeleton knight(behind fireplace
all east, pull lever)
Venom and hellfire guards it deep within the crypts.-tomb s of DE with spiders
 you move skeleton and wind up in the room, its on the ground.
place of supplication=?(probably priest)

This stuff i kept in here just for other locations where items have spawned.

Get the silver chip from the chapel. A figure is guarding it. Just get all, kill, get all.

Get the Icon of Ravenloft from the Crypt. Its in the dead centre of the crypt. It'll automatically join with the chip just like bloodthorn does.

This icon will allow you to go into Strahd's crypt. south,stairs,enter.

He'll go ahahah you cant kill me, I'm the gingerbread man. You need a special weapon.

Goto the Library, enter fireplace, turn sconce, open book / read all three pages.

Sergi the guard has a cursed tool that Strahd is none too happy with on page 3.

Sergi is the skeletal guard one room east of the 10 doom guards near Helga. Kill him and something questy happens, but I got no sword.

While just wandering and seeing what I could see, there was a new mob near debaucherat. Werewolf, blocking the cells. He looked like a normal Rloft wanderer but dropped a special sword. I believe this is the sword Strahd is not immune to.

As a mage I can't wield it. I hope I don't have to.

That's it so far. You need more items, how many, I don't know.

Presumably when you enter the crypt,  with them all, Strahd will either fight you, or just have a questy-death.

If someone wants to wiegh in and finish this off, I wouldn't be complaining.




Enter, enter, burn sludge (if you have lantern and get sludged) 
 
Go e s e climb climb 2w 2n w, kill guard, get icon.  Go e, s, enter fireplace, turn torch, e, move webs, pull lever, kill knight, get chip, Icon is formed. 
 
Go out, w, push brick, enter cart, n, 2w, se, e, d, get longsword (it might not be here  I cant remember  but it is just laying on the floor someplace).  Go 3w, s, 2e, d, w, 3n, 2d, get stone from hand 7, place black stone in brazier, centerdoor, u, 2e, jump, 3e, s, stairs, e, get hilt, Sunsword is formed. 
 
Go 3w, s, stairs, wield sword, enter, kill strahd, get amulet.  Get a tp out of the castle, go back to Donavitch, bless amulet, done.


guild quests


BREED GUILD QUEST:
from cot, go n, w, 2n, e, n, all e, cave, youll be in the Vale of eras...the 
start of the breed quest. Now you want go in a southern/eastern direction until 
you find a room with a bridge crossing in it (it will have "There is a bridge 
crossing here." in the last line of the room description). From there, go 2s, 
then go in a southern/western direction until you find the small village(just 
walk around the SW corner of the map until you find 2 rooms with different 
exits, like 'enter' or 'steps' to signify the village) Anyway find those 2 
rooms, and enter each one, and talk to the 2 people in them. Say things like 
'breed' 'trees' and 'aramus'. After you get the general idea, get back out. Now 
go in the eastern direction, and kind of southern once you go east a while. 
You're looking for a room that has 'the trees seem to form a ring here' or 
something, it will be in the last line of  the description. If you get lost, go 
back to the bridge crossing, go all east, and all south, and look around there 
for the room. Anyway when you find it, type 'push through', and youll be in a 
room with a flat stone on the ground. 'stand on stone' then 'close eyes'. Now 
you should be in the hard part of the quest(well hard if you dont like riddles, 
but hey...thats why you're reading this...) You should be at the antrance of the 
Flux and se a 'worn signpost' in your room. If you want to solve this "semi-fun" 
part on your own, read the sign and figure it out....otherwise read on for the 
answer. 

After reading the sign, you might realize that its a riddle, you have to follow 
the beginning letter(direction) of EVERY third word on the signpost. So we move 
on...go: 3w, n, 2w, 3s, e, s, e, s, 3w, n, 2e, 2n, 4w. Viola, you should reach 
the City of Light! Go 'archway' to enter it...then go 4 north. You should be at 
the entrance of the tower. Go 'tower' and youll be at the bottom. Now 
listen....you HAVE TO read the pedestals in the upper floors and memorize the 
info or copy it down in a text file, theyll ask you about it when they interview 
you. So we continue...go up, and there should be a pedestal in the room with 
you(look in description). Type 'push panel' and youll get a LONG history of the 
breed. Once again, copy this down. When done, go up. In this room, type 'push 
panel' again, and copy down that part of the history. When finished, go all the 
way up to the top of the tower(should be one more room up, but i forget). When 
at the top youll see an orb. Look at it, if it says 'you see your face in it' it 
means youve lost and cannot be accepted as a breed. Otherwise, type 'touch orb' 
and it will ask you to accept. (Just kidding about that last part) Touch it! Now 
it will tell you a breed will be in contact with you in due time. 
Congratulations....youve "solved" the quest. Now find your way back out(follow 
the reverse of the directions i gave you)....and go waste some time before you 
get recruited. It usually takes around 2 days to 2 weeks before someone 
interviews you, if you dont bug them to.


GREEBY QUEST - ANALYZE ARMOUR
---------------------------------------
from tower, go 2s, w, nw, enter say glasses, say flux wire, buy flux wire, 
out, se, e, all n, enter red velocopod, go in a couple room and 'search 
gloria crystals' and 'get shards', when you have 2 shards of gloria crystals, 
go back to velocopod, enter velocopod, 5s, 3w, n, ne, enter, give shards to 
lartal(hell make you lenses), out, ne, e, s, w, enter say glasses, shell

bushes, e, say greebies, say rid, no go in EVERY room in this area 
and 'enter hole', while wearing the glasses type 'pry greebies' then 'kill 
greeby', keep doing this until each crystal hole is empty. You will evntually 
kill them all and have to wait for the rooms to reset to get the rest(you 
need 50 in all), once you think youve killed 50, go back to Orli and 'say 
finished' for your new working :) Analyse Armour. Its kind of a lore power, 
but it'll destroy the item.

MOUSE QUEST (mini)
---------------------------
Find the Tyrom the Merchant walking around the City of Light, and 'buy 
mouse trap'. Then 'set trap' and walk into another room. When you hear 
the trap go off, go back and get it and give it back to the merchant.

FIRE CRYSTAL QUEST (mini)
---------------------------
Go to the crystal caverns in the SE corner of the Valley of Eras(map it!). 
From the entrance of the caverns go e, ne, e, se, search glow, search 
corner(you should get crystal), enlarge crack, crawl through crack, w, sw, w, 
out, go back to Rila in the shop 2n, w, enter from tower, and give her the 
crystal.

THE GREAT CRYSTAL - RESERVE
-----------------------------------
Ray from guild shop wants a great crystal. So go to the caverns in far 
eastern Chaos mountains - the guild area. Search debris/rubble in just 
about every room. Theres a se room thats a pit, this is for the fire gem 
quest. Dont go down there. Leaving is trivial but you dont need to go down 
there. You should find an emerald, a ruby, a sapphire, and an Energy 
crystal or something. In the first door room, insert ruby/sapphire/emerald. 
Door opens. Go north, flip switch, get crystal. Next door room. replace 
crystal (energy crystal), open door, flip switch get gem. Next room. Go to 
the room with the pit. Just before it. Search walls and stuff, you'll find a 
panel with several gems you can twist or turn. Just keep turning them until 
they slot into place. A bridge appears. open door, se, flip switch get crystal, 
fuse crystal, return it to Ray for the reserve working. Which uses the Talar 
crystal.

THE SEVEN TONES - DUALITY
--------------------------------
First, go to the tower, stand on star, e, peer structure, say lost lore, leave, 
w, focus tower, out, 2e, s, enter, u, say lost lore, say , d, 
out, n, 2w, tower,  step on star, 2n, say lost lore, say regain, say tones, 
say , 2s, focus tower, out, 4s, 2w, enter, place hand on 
plate, say tones, say vessel, 2out, 2e, 4n, 3w, n, enter, say vestuar(Ray 
will give you the vestuar), out, s, 3e, 4s, 2w, enter place hand on plate, 
give vestuar to Pravit, now you can 'recall' and see the locations of the 
Seven Tones. Type 'recall' and get the locations throughout the realms, 
and goodluck finding them :) after you have found all seven, goto the 
bantha portal, into the vault, and use psisense. it'll give you the syntax to 
unleash the tones. its a puzzle, and may change from person to person. 
you'll get a duality working for your time.

TREVA RUNES
---------------
Chaos Treva Rune: 3e, 2s, 2e, n, 3e, n, 2w, n, step rune, enter, request aduvio. This will boost your confidence gain per working up until about tier 
60. Do it early.

DAMAGED CRYSTAL - REPEL
------------------------------

Theres a room in the guild you cant enter. After you've done great crystal 
you can. Go in there, and say hi. crystal. etc. He'll tell you his pet has 
eaten his crystal and he wants to get it vomited up. You'll need to find a 
nwerm leaf. Whatsisname in the Valley of Eras will know more. One of the 
valley rooms (steps exit), say nwerm. And he'll tell you the leaf is quite 
common, in a magical realm with a lot of tree cover. This is not in fact the 
chaos mountains, or the green velocopod. But Fantasy itself. Go to wforest, 
find a nwerm leaf (its an alchemy reagent) and just give it to the pet. Pet 
vomits crystal. Get it, and give it. Its corrupt. Go to gem shop. Give it. Its 
fixed. Go back. Give it to the npc. You now have repel. It has flare as a 
base skill. And gives you significant tanking boost as high upkeep.

ICE CAVE - THERMAL SINK
-----------------------------

Ice cave. Find that merchant in the city and buy a fire starter kit. Go to the 
cave. Find the room with the Ice Wall and 'build fire'. Go north after the 
wall melts and I think you have to 'contact Synzal' contact comes after 
level 5 contacting. You'll need level 6 contact, and level 6 willpower to 
successfully contact. If it doesnt work, then you'll need 5s in other skills. 
My skills at were 6C/6W/5 across the board. You'll get thermal sink, which 
is compared to what else you've earned, amazing gxp per round.


ISLE OF GARAT - REPOSE
----------------------------

Go to the isle of Garat. That's the green velocopod in the City of Light. 
Enter green. 2s,2e,psiscan. Read the story. 2w,3s,search the runes and 
such. Search the island in general (plants) for a bontur leaf. Eat it. Go back 
to this second room mentioned, eat the leaf and swim. psiscan. tap node.
You'll get repose. Which functions like meditate. But you don't get hp 
regen. In trade, you get to maintain your workings whilst reposing, making 
it much more useful than meditate.

Visit Pooki Maya to start the quest. Enter tree at point 6. Go up a bit and talk
to her. After you've said what you need to, you can 'kneel' to her to begin the 
quest, or 'bow' to her for a +1 wis boon. She grants you the clarity to get past
a dragons barrier. Or some such. First dragon on the menu is Char. He is 500k
and immune to fire.

One important thing of note, you must deal the killing blow to the dragon, no
external sources of damage will fire the quest trigger. As a summoning mage, for
me this meant taking multiple Blood Wands in to finish it off, after wearing the
mob down to under 5% hp.

So be careful on this quest with priest summons, or Wraithvein summons, et al.

Okay, Char's cavern is at point 1. Go there and climb down, theres a Str check,
and its higher than 30. I don't know how much higher. Climb up is the return dir.
Ubel the Goblin may block the down exit, I can't recall.

1: Up/Out              2: Down            3: Down to Dragon      C: Char


Head down to Char. Theres a tonne of looping exits that are a right pain in
the arse, thus why fully completed maps are provided. You can get disoriented
very easily, and theres a whole lot of agro hunters, so watch you don't stack
out too highly.

Once you get to the X room before 3, you will need to 'search script'.
The return dir is 'flip switch'. Go down, kill the guardians, say crystals to
char, and then kill him. 500k, no charm, no leave, fire immunity. Medium hits,
excellent tank.

You should fire the quest trigger, and be told to seek out the bay. Head topside
and do that. Go to point 2 on the main map, and search waters/enter. Kill all the
dumb mobs.

   1: Up/Out       2: Nolmo Leafwind
   3: Down         L: Sea Dragon


Visit the X room closest to 3, and search rocks, walls, etc and you'll see a door.
It is locked. Visit the X room closest to 2, and search mud, to get transported to 2,
which contains a lost hobbit from Tookwich. Talk to him a bit, and eventually
'free nolmo', which makes Nolmo share his secret. He has the key to the door, but he 
buried it in Xaxis.

Head to tookwich, and search a bunch of stuff. If theres any point in the quest that
is diverse to slow the spread of qinfo, this will be it. For me, the shovel was in a
room with only a north west exit, on the southern side of Tookwich, guarded by a hobbit
found by searching tools.

Now go to Xaxis with your shovel, as directed by Nolmo. There is four gardens in the
city, and they are all intersections closest to the Non-Agro Xill Warriors, two on the
north end, and two on the south. 'dig dirt' in all of these rooms until you come across
a key. It'll work first try if you're in the right room, so no need to spam.

Jump back into the sea dragons cavern complex, unlock the door and proceed down. Dispatch
guardians, say crystals, dispatch dragon, and move on. You'll be told to seek out the lair
below the Great Goblin. That's Gibbergeist if you havent been paying attention for the last
few years. I got in the room by searching mat, after Gibby died, but the blue message
mentions the bed, so perhaps thats a valid search also. Climb ladder is the reverse dir.

The dirs for this section may be a bit broken. I kinda got a bit messed up, and this section 
was pretty simple, so I didn't spend much time on it. Head from 1 to 2, search symbols, trace
symbols, down to the Sky Dragon, dispatch guardians, say crystals, kill dragon. Again, 500k,
no peace, no leave.

It'll then tell you to go visit the Supreme Arch Mage in the golden tower.

Kill your way up to tristar, and say secret. He has a secret to tell you, but won't tell you
unless you kill Christos and provide proof that he is dead. Good news, you don't have to kill
Christos. He's already long dead.  If you've explored thoroughly you'll have already found him.

Down into Stygion's Caverns you go. Point 4 on the main map.

This is the worst looper of them all, took forever to map out. Head to C, dispatching agro hunters
on your way. Enter circle, search corpse, and back to Tristar. 'offer corpse' for the quest update.

You'll need 3 Crystals of Ao, which you already have, and a Vial of powder that Tristar tells you 
is laying about the tower somewhere. For me it was in a drawer on the second floor of the tower,
in the same room that has the down exit to level 1.  Head back to Stygion's Caverns, go to point 2.

Make sure you're prepared, there is no return exit for this section. Sprinkle powder when you're
ready.

Head down, dispatch the guardians. These ones are bigger than the rest, 250k each if I recall.

Dispatch, prepare, and in you go. Like the others its not agro, its also not immune to fire or The
Blood Wand. This one's bigger however, 720k. Say crystals, collect yourself, and take it down.

When you're done, high tail it to Pooki, and 'proffer crystals'. 90 qp for your time, and the 
Hunting Grounds will now be open to you to play in. A small area with some whips, Bone Ring of Ao
and a unique item carried by the General inside. I do not know what the item was, I only saw a
Ghostly Artifact. Fin.

and Light will appear. Kill him and he may have 'Light Prism' (it's 
unique). No you have to go around the whole island and collect all 
of the items from every mob. The mobs appear in strange ways. You 
either have to wait in the room for a couple of seconds, kill other 
mobs first to spawn others, or do something else wierd. Once you have 
all of the items (check back later for the list, or refer to the 
description of the armour on the 3karmour.ssxh.net set. It will 
describe every piece in the armour), find 'Green' (he wanders around 
near the entrance to the area). Give him the Resilient Hide first, 
then all of the other items with the hide one by one in whatever 
order. After you give him all of them, you'll have the White Complete 
Hide Armour {glimmering}. If you didn't get all the items it will be 
something else, like "Furry, Complete Hide Armour". Just keep trying 
to add the missing items until you get it to White.

Anyone know where the dragon champion is? He's basically the last mystery I want solved apart from the 7 quests left to do.

w/n/n/w/s/w/s/w/n/w/n/w/s/s/w/s/s/e/s/s/e/challenge champion






dragonball z


The task is to collect 7 Dragon balls, and presumably do something with 
them. The quest takes place inside channel 1 of the chaos TV. The 'old' 
DBZ arena is completely unrelated to the quest.

Dragon Ball 1: Bulma's.

If you talk to her long enough, she will give you a Dragon Ball radar that 
needs a battery. Kill one of the scientists in the Capsule Corp HQ for the 
pod it carries, throw pod. It'll either turn into a meal, or a battery. Combine 
the two, walk around the general DBZ area, and you'll come across a ball.

Dragon Ball 2: Gohan

Inside Gohan's house, in the livingroom is a photo of Gohan with a 
Dragonball attached to his hat. Talking to his mother reveals he is out. 
Searching his bedroom shows a map of the forest, depicting (for me at 
least) Gohan's treehouse being in the northwest section of the forest. Go 
in that general area, and start climbing trees. Talk to Gohan. He'll give you 
the dragonball if you give him some  meat. The meat he 
wanted from me was in a cave due east from him, carried by a mob. 
Acquire food. Make the trade.

Dragon Ball 3: Goku

Simple. Find Goku, and kill him. I forget which npc tells where his hidden 
training camp is, but its on the western side of the forest, with a south east 
entrance hidden in bushes. The fight will stop after a while and you'll get 
the ball. He looks like about 60k.

Dragon Ball 4: The Magazine One (bring a light source)

Jump on the boat to the island, and talk to the npc's. One is locked 
behind a door, and refuses to come out until he's given a dirty magazine. 
Theres a shape changer nearby who doesn't want to help you out unless 
he has the most comfortable underwear in the universe, or some 
nonsense. How he helps you is by shapeshifting into a shovel. I've not 
tested if a normal shovel will do the trick. Head out of the house, and 
down the southern path. You'll eventually fall off and land in a fountain. 
Follow the only path you can, and bring light. You'll end up in a giant 
clothes dresser, kill some mobs, and get the grundie undies. Head out 
through the one way path, hand over the dacks. The shapeshifter will 
become the shovel. Go out to the beach, and dig in every room until you 
come across the magazine.

Note. I may be kinda, wrong about this. This is the first time I'm writing a 
solution for it, and I attempted the quest weeks ago. I vaguely recall 
something about a turtle being involved. All the pertinent details are here.

-If you leave the house and go west and examine rocks, then search rocks, one of the rocks is the turtle.  Ask him about the magazine he tells you to get oolong to shape-shift into a shovel.

Dragon Ball 5: The Thief Guy

Theres a thief in a cave, guarding a chest. When you kill him, he says the 
key is in safe hands. Ask everyone about 'key'. One of the NPC's upstairs 
in the island house looks guilty about it. Kill Krillin and get the key. It 
would be good form to ask all the npc's. Unlock the chest. Tada.  

-Might be on other z-fighters, i had to kill tien for my key.

Dragon Ball 6: The Dragon Guy

The dragon in the floating island in the tower has a ball. Kill piccolo, and 
head on up. Find a way to fly (levitating also works) and head out the west 
window. Have a chat, and get a ball. He will ask one question, and the 
answer is found in the tower on the various exhibits.

Dragon Ball 7: King Kai

From Roshi's house go back to snake way, follow it to the end (kill street sweepers on the way or they will knock you off) where you 
can go up. its a small planet, with looping exits, although the planet only 
contains 4 rooms. One room has a tree, one a convertable, one the jump 
exit, and one King Kai's house. Enter the house. (w,n,enter). Say hi, 
comedy, humor, jokes, dragonball. Leave, and go to the tree (s), 
look/search tree, look/search branches, and bubbles will pop out. Kill it. It 
wanders fast, but will stay still after it is attacked. Go back to King Kai, 
recite 1, wait, recite 2, wait, recite 3.

*Bubbles can also be under the table in king kai's house*

What you do with all the balls:

'summon the eternal dragon' to recieve your quest points. Prior to getting 
the quest points, you can wish for something. 'i wish for an enhanced body' 
is a stat boon, indefinate +6 con, +6 str, +6 dex. I don't know what the 
weapon/armour is.
-The armour is a "Shroud of the Eternal Dragon"...the desc hypes it up but as far as i can tell it's not even par with tarnished gear.

You carefully study The Mighty Z-Sword (enchanted)...
A warrior would be proud to use this.
This does absurd slashing damage.
This weapon has special attacks or powers.
Big bucks and no whammys!
There seems to be more that can be learned from this object.

> lore legend sword
You carefully study The Mighty Z-Sword (enchanted)...
This item has a detailed history:
This sword radiates with extreme power.  Very few weapons in bardic lore
rival this one.

decent weapon, like mandibles


the browning murders


to get here in chaos: 3e5s, out2, admire ring

all east, all north, enter, talk to the ghost. you need 10 pieces of a picture:

Piece 1:
room w/ ghost, untie rope for it.

pry panel, ride elevator up.

Piece 2: 
ne, play piano, kill mob

Piece 3:
w, u, e, turn third candle, kill mob

Piece 4:
w, nw, search flowers, kill mob

Piece 5:
w, n, search clock, kill mob

Piece 6:
w, break ball, kill mob

Piece 7:
ne, kill dog, in, exa chimney, kill mob

Piece 8:
out, w, u, nw, open box, kill mob

Piece 9:
up, search shape, kill mob

Piece 10:
slide, dig ground, kill mob

east till you get to a picture frame, assemble pieces, put picture in frame
kill jacob, quest done.

Note: Each player has a different instance, and sometimes the pieces wont
drop on killing blow. look at the mob before killing it. That seems to avoid
the problem. It could all be for nothing. But maybe not. The pieces do
load in the same place for everyone, 


merciful miller


First things first, you'll want to tear your hair out doing this quest.

Most of this quest contributed by E. Rewrite by B.

Find Nyess in the Wayhaven Bazaar, say hel, involved, beauty, brother,
 imprisoned, crett, persisted, arrested, cityguard, jaamis, cell, bars.

Now head 9n from Wayhaven north gate, and go path. It's a hidden exit.

Go north, search grass. You may find a scythe. If you can't find it here, it 
may well be in another room. If not, scythes from areas such as rampage 
as long as they are a 'polearm' will also work, I'm told. 2w, pedal, sharpen 
scythe, 2e, s, harvest summer wheat (you can do it three times, and you'll 
probably want to).

The most annoying aspect of this quest is room resets. Which will undo 
various things you've done, and you may not notice, because it doesnt 
affect everything. Most notably, it may make the milling stone /undress 
itself/. You'll see underprocessed wheat if it has undressed through a reset.

In the same room as the scythe, search bushes, collect blueberries.

Next up, w, search desk, swipe ledger, swipe tongs, pickup ember. get 
coal, w, untie rope, open trapdoor, hook myself or , lower 
myself or , push wall, e, talk to the npc for a backstory. It's 
actually not relevant to the quest. Theres some bottles of wine in here, 
also not relevant to the quest. Perhaps it might be, I'll explain later.


w, double-check sacks/pallets/inventory. Pallets should say it was out of 
whack, and you'll find a recipe to make bread. I'm told you don't need the 
recipe, but there's where you find it.

w, u, open door, u, lower chain, d, hookup set 1, u, raise chain, unhook 
set 1, dress set 2, hookup set 2, lower chain, d, unhook set 1.

This will put a fully dressed flouring millstone on the miller.

Find master Aruwin, and talk to him for a while. To get his key you can 
either kill him, or whisper deal, and bribe him with 200 coins. For questing 
diversity, it is possible that he will want a bottle of wine for the key. Thus 
the hidden wine cellar with the back story about Aruwin being an Alcoholic.

Get his key, head into the kitchen, unlock door, e, L/S bookshelves, 
peruse titles. Read the milling book you recieve. All the details matter in 
this quest. West, search cabinets (yeast), search pantry (jar), get milk 
(also in pantry, but you have to get it), search dishes (bowl). w, search 
nesting area (egg), open/search footlocker for a note relating to the 
inventorying of sacks that we already did earlier. Also look at the cot, 
and 'take and empty the pillow'. This gets you a fine canvas sack.

By now you should have some coal, a ledger, a recipe, an egg, a bowl, 
some bread dough, honey pot, jar of milk, blueberries, a key, book on 
milling principles, tongs with ember in it.

You'll need a chisel now. There's at least two locations for it, and with 
different syntax. You can use my strategy, look at chisel in every room, or 
you can actually give a toss and try to find it properly. One set is in the 
storage room upstairs - nab chisel, one set is near the fireplace, forget the 
syntax. You'll see it in a pile of tools.

Now go to the storage room (one of the chisel locations) and search cases 
for a scroll, break seal.

Down a bit, to the prepared milling room. swivel chute (over the mill), 
swing gate open, open door, e, pull lever, w, all up.

look/search mechanism, 'disengage brake', climb ladder (hidden exit). 

Look at the weathervane for the direction of the wind. turn crank clockwise 
or counter-clockwise to match - unlike real weather, if wind is 
blowing /from/ the south east (meaning its blowing northwest) you don't 
face the sail northwest. Face it also south east. Its bad wording, not poor 
coding.

Wait for at least a firm gust. A strong gust is best. Then read the scroll 
(once), you don't need to read it twice. Put the sail in Full Sail (raise sail 
many times) and keep checking the weathervane and crank shaft to see 
how fast you're going and if you're in the right direction.

When it has been adequate for a while (I don't know if spinning quickly is 
too fast) adequate and /still accellerating/ just to be safe, go to the grain 
hopper, load wheat, head west and wait a few rounds whilst still checking 
that crank. After it emotes once, saying it has processed some of the 
grain, it is in fact finished. Go down, look in the cone to see if you have 
perfect wheat, and pull cord.

Perfectly milled wheat will appear in your sack. Or underprocessed if you're 
using the wrong stone or the stone undressed itself over a room reset. I 
had no success processing wheat twice. I doubt it would work well, as thats 
why you can get multiple wheat when harvesting.

Right, the horribly annoying milling process is over. 

u,open door,e,e,start fire,mix ingredients (wait for it to tell you to insert 
stuff), insert chisel, bake bread (wait), go to Wayhaven, find the woman, 
and 'give bread to nyess'. If you attempt to 'give bread to woman', you'll 
screw up the quest and have to do the wind all over again. Haahhha. Cry.



schroedingers cat


*if you open the box, you will kill the cat and stop the quest*

from sci: u4ndnwn,enter

Talk to schroedinger. say hi, distracted, yes to his experiment, cat. He tells
you he needs his notes.  The notes are in the middle drawer west of
schroedinger.The key for the middle drawer is 2 west.  exa walls. pull tile,
get key. Get the notes and give them to schroedinger. He tells you there is a
page missing.Play around a little bit and then come back to this room and look
at the workbenches, especially the north and south.  On the north workbench
there is a screwdriver(exa tools, grab it).  Also, there is a pyramid that has
buttons on it. the pyramid color levels change each time you press a button.
Get all of the layers to "flashing steadily" and the red one to glowing brilliantly.
Then look at the south workbench and exa globes, exa wires. reconnect blue
wire.  There is also somerthing about a green wire with a screw,  tighten screw.
Press green button and the machines wil come to life and produce a can of 
wd-180, use this to derust the top cabinet drawer west of schroedinger.  Get the
paper from here and give it to schroedinger.  He says he needs an actuator and
doesn't remember where his stick to open the bottom drawer is.  say cane and
borrow and he'll let you use his cane(fuck around first).  go west, pry bottom 
drawer with cane and get the actuator.  give actuator to schroedinger.  When
"time pauses", open box and it's done.


encampment


ncampment is found in West Forest. 

e,5s,all w,nw,w,nw,w,sw,s,clear log,nw,n,nw,clear path,w from Wforest.

It contains 15 formal miniquests at the moment, with more to come, 1 
informal miniquest, and a whole bevy of excellent mobs and secrets. But 
first, the Miniquests.



=======================================
Jix gives: Mystical Components, Magical Essence, and Magical Enchantment.


MYSTICAL COMPONENTS

Components can be done straight away. You'll need 5 bits of ore from the 
mountain. To get to the mountain goto one of the E/W forest exists 
(theres only three of them) and search branch, north, push through 
branches. And 5 roots. They are in the frozen section of the forest on the 
way to the mountain, and some of the general mountai nrooms.


MAGICAL ESSENCE

Essence will need you to collect 5 Ice Wolf tails (plentiful) found on the 
mountain, and 5 essences from elementals, also found on the mountain 
and also plentiful.


MAGICAL ENCHANTMENT

Enchantment is the final formal quest, and cannot be done until all others 
are done. It will be explained in detail below.



=======================================
Rigel gives: Thief Catching and Scout the realm.


THIEF CATCHING

Thief catching can be done straight away, you need to kill Jarl. You don't 
need to fuck around with heads, etc, simply killing him (the player needs 
to deal the killing blow, not an external damage source) will update the 
quest. Jarl is about 200k, and is found near the mountain. Instead of 
pushing through branches, just go north again and take care of it.


SCOUT THE REALM

Scout the realm can be done after Thief Catching, you will need to visit 
several places. The first is medlar, visit every room that you can get to - 
free stag rooms are not nescessary. he second location is Syrina's Faerie 
Glade. It's a hidden area in Eforest, enter gap in one of the rooms near 
Kohls Elves (eremon), and visit every room. The third is Rampage. Vraal's 
rampage. Visiting the first room is sufficient, that is the ones with 
Venomant in it. You have to leave that room to make it update. I 
understand it's a long trip back. How you get out of there, I know not. I 
got a buggy death in there after getting my update.

The guard at westersea gives an unlinked quest, that will matter in the 
near future, but currently can be ignored. 'scout for the camp' simply 
requires you to visit the camp and see all the rooms. I do not know if the 
battlefield is nescessary.



=======================================
Mappe the armourer gives the worst quests. 
The first one is Mappe's ring, and it's long. 


MAPPE's RING

First you have to find waight. Go into the tent to the south of 
the camp, visit all the rooms. You'll overhear someone talking about 
Waight and the quest will update. Go to waight. He's in the southwest 
corner of the battlefield. AND THE BATTLE FIELD IS VERY VERY DANGEROUS. 
Talk to him and he'll want some bandages. Go to the doctors tent on the 
eastern edge of the battlefield, get the bandages (simply saying 
bandages updates the quest. Back to waight, hand them over with a say, 
He'll say he fought a man and the man ate the ring. Find the man, he's 
with the doctor. Unconscious. In order to cure him you need a shinbone 
from a skeleton. Goto the graveyard, and kill every skeleton there is. And 
this part sucks. The shinbone is an extremely low load rate. I had to kill 
over 100 skeletons before getting my shinbone. Go back to the doctor, 
work out the syntax. The patient wakes up, but he needs to pass the ring. 
Go to the cook. The cook wont give you food. [Continued].


The cook gives you a mission to do. Find 5 bits of wolf meat. Only the 
wolves and foxes at the beginning of the mountain will do. The ice Wolves 
won't trigger the quest. Complete it, and continue with Mappe's ring.

[Resume]. Ask for food again, and the cook will give you some. Go to the 
doctor, and say food. The guy will shit out the ring. Go to the well, clean 
ring. And finally go to Mappe, and return it. Phew. That was annoying.


MAPPE'S SILVER CHAIN

Mappe's next quest is Mappe's silver chain. Straight forward, but you've 
got to be buff. One of the champions has the chain. The champions on the 
battlefield. They are found, from the exit to the battlefield, either s,w,scale 
pile, or s,e,scale pile. The west one is 1.52m, and attacks with poison. The 
east one is 1.52m, and attacks with edged. Choose your poison. Kill it until 
the quest updates. Could take as many as 10 tries. I got it in two.


MAPPE'S RECYCLING

Mappe's final quest is Mappe's Recycling. This could take a while, it took 
me three days with help.

Important note. You don't have to kill the mob to get a trinket. You just 
need to be present when it dies. You can use this to your advantage on 
some of the harder stuff, but I've been told if its abused, it will be 
changed. It is tolerated in moderation.


To beat this quest you need 10 small trinkets, 10 medium trinkets, and 10 
large trinkets.

Smalls: Tired Warriors in the tower. 150k each, and they come in a pair. 
Medium Load.
** Champions and Isa will also have a small trinket for you, if you need it.

Mediums: Mischievous Small Man, All  the Mobs in the Tent, Warriors in 
Training, Powerful Warriors.
** Champions and Isa will also have a medium trinket for you, if you need 
it. Low load.

Large: Large Warriors, Isa, Champions of the Hill, Supreme Combattants 
only. Medium load.

Master: Isa only. 100% Load Rate.

Your reward for getting that done is 10k coins, and the 50 million xp you 
acquired doing it. Note, Champions with multi trinkets will try to fill a small 
slot FIRST, a medium slot second, and a large slot last. So if you want 
champions to fill up your large straight out, you will be disappointed.



=======================================
Next comes Doctor's quests. He'll let you do medical materials straight 
away. Roots and Something else. Straight forward gather mission. Tedious.


PURIFICATION

Doctor's purification quest. The cmission is misleading. Just go to the well 
and type purify water.


FOOD FOR CAMP

Cook's final quest. More food for camp. 10 Wolf meat, again, only from 
the foxes and brown wolves. And 20 fish. Only one room, the bridge. Just 
type 'fish' to make it happen. You can fish every 10 seconds, for a limit of 
about 20 times. It should only take a few hours to get the fihs.



=======================================
Final Mission is from Jix. Magical Enchantment. 



=======================================
IMPORTANT

This mission will not save in your book. Make sure you reacquire the quest 
before you take on Ioth-Tah.


IMPORTANT

This mission makes you kill Ioth-Tah.

He's in the Cemetary. I suppose the aura helps. I'm not sure.
To do it, go to the south side of the cemetary, 'form a cross', two south, 
open chest. For an aura. Get the bead as described in Equipment 
information, every bit helps, and form a party together. You will need 
multiple big hitters. As it is a rapidly healing mob. When the first person 
attacks, everyone will be drawn in.

Go into the building. 'touch pentagram' followed by 'insert fingers'. In the 
north most room, 'speak bat' to solve the riddle, 'move left brazier' for a 
gem, go south, and 'insert gem into hole'. West, 'speak lava'. East, 'speak 
wife'. Kill the guards in the pedestal room, and go down. Search the 
ground for a shard. 


IMPORTANT

For parties, this room is currently a bit iffy. Make sure you go one at a 
time, and give yourself a rooms buffer. Ie, no two people in the same 
room at the same time, up until Ioth-Tah. The bats will cause problems.

If you havent solved the bats problem, 17 gxpless class 3 agro bats will 
attack you with edged hits. If someone is in the bat room and you go in, 
they'll come anyway. At least they did for me. Scary stuff. Died three times 
and had to pay for my tanks resurrection.

Get to the lava room, 'cross river' if you've solved the lava problem. And 
go north. You're at Ioth-Tah.

He's 800k heals like a motherfucker, summons up to two minions out, carries
the dubious reward of sword and armour. I don't know how worth while it is.
Your quest should update. Go to jix and say complete for your scroll.


At this point you have now finished all the current miniquests, and got your 
first Ioth-Tah scroll. Killing Ioth/getting scroll can be done as much as you 
like, and everyone with the mission in the flip book gets a scroll just for 
being there. Regardless of how much of the load you are carrying.

You'll now be told about the talisman of power. Ive seen it made once. It 
looks interesting. The first section comes from Ioth-Tah, you should have 
it now. The second section comes from the ice cave encounter, and thats 
fucking hard. (goto the ice cave, mimic statue, open compartment, get 
chisel, north, carve ice, flip switch, north, scar tree)

It needs to be bashed down with a serious party with some serious beat 
down. Thats the centre piece of the medallion. Right, I know not. When 
you've got them all, I presume they will join together simply or 
automatically. Take the shard from the cemetary described above, goto 
the ice glade on the other side of the mountain, 'restore vase', and do 
something with the pillar of light and the medallion. It does damage, 
heals, the works. pretty sick by all accounts. But the effort to do so is 
insane.


Talisman of Power
--------------------

Not much point making it if you haven't completed all of the Miniquests.

When you complete Ioth-Tah, Jix will mention the talisman of power, and 
give you one of the command words. Its unique per player, so the amulet
does not have any share-ability. That's okay. Its BS.

The commandword Jix will give you is for its blasting power. Which after 
testing appears to do 500 damage per hit for free.

Other command words can supposedly be acquired by talking to various 
NPC's in the camp. As I've only made it once, I don't care all that much.

To make the talisman of power, one must kill Ioth-Tah, for the left side of 
the talisman. One must kill the Purple Worm in underdark, (near ghoti) 
s,e,u,search(many times),climb wall,ne,(levitate or fly),nw,n,kill for the ride 
side. And for the centre piece, the Ice encounter described above.

Then simply 'bind talisman'. 

The first time you use one of the powers, you'll supposedly be zapped for 
10 int. I was zapped for 25, but I think the other int was from Hoofaralig. 
None of it is mentioned on stats. So, you've got to really like ammy 
ammy. You can't even get some chump to take the hit for you. No sir, it's 
gonna cost you int. Nor does quitting and coming back help. It forgets you 
have used it once.

It has a variety of powers, I've only used the blast one. Its a 13k donate.


newbie quests for HM

attrition: found a mirror in carnelians lair


Ralintaro:
In wayhaven library, search each tapestry until you find one with a
loose thread then 'pull thread'.  go all east, north, search mud and
you find a skeleton.  get the scroll, go west, north, chant whatever
word is on the scroll.  north, east, sr peg, turn peg, reach hand into
compartment, get scroll, west, north, search dust for the pen.  west
kill guardian, trace symbol with pen.

Codename Kodiac:
Exactly the same solve as newbieland, found in the holopads of Midways 
Space Station.

Chop Tree:
Supposedly found in any tree filled area of fantasy, with every character 
I've played its been within the first 10 rooms of the Portal of Life. To date, 
I have never found it in Newbieland.

Attrition.
I've found it once with one of my characters, and never found it again. I 
*suspect* that its entry point was open, but it was not my entry point. 
Thus I got in, but if I was trying to open the entrance, it would not have 
worked. I did not think much of it at the time, now I regret not getting my 
100 explored rooms.

Anyway.

Two locations I'm aware of. 1. The Island of Kelon, inside the hut. This is 
the location I found. The roc dropped me there, but you can swim to it 
from near Djinni/Kimlark/Taslen ships/docks. Inside the hut, the entrance 
point was a mirror, but I've never seen the mirror again, so if this is your 
spot, theres some looking and searching to do. My understanding is the 
entrance is per player, not per boot.

Another entry point is Zalastas towers. On every floor you can go N/W/S/E - 
one of - and in one of the rooms should be a mirror entry point. This too, 
is not my entry point. Meaning there is, at bare minimum, at least one 
more entry point. I presume the solve is identical, but as a Jugger at the 
time, the mobs are quite tough for 50k.

I can't even remember what the other HM quests are, but I'm sure I know 
where they are. Havent logged in for a while. One week of crippling lag to 
go.
